As the market continues to fall and the year is closing out, this will be the worst year ever. Even if the slow steady slide fianlly stops, the price of bitcoin will probably still have a loss of over 60% since it&amp;#39;s all time high last November.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad news makes Bitcoin drop. Good news makes it drop too. That means that there are people waiting to exit. They want out. Big whales from the early days are cashing out. Little fish that can&amp;#39;t survive without an occasional sale are being forced to sell. Longs are going bust. And the people at Buttcoin? Guess what...they are throwing huge parties from all the money they made shorting cryptos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The newest TA lines show the price dropping to near $260. The $233 mark will probably get tested. Blood is everywhere. Some of it is yours. On a personal level, many of us are out on a limb. We believed in Bitcoin so strongly that we invested all our spare cash. We sold stock &amp;amp; precious metals and invested in BTC. We put off car repairs. We refused to spend money on luxuries. We avoided paying bills every time that BTC dropped and grabbed a bit more. We had faith. We HODL. Every drop in price was another grab. When the price went to $600, it was &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot;, BTC on sale. When it went to $500, it was &amp;quot;double wow&amp;quot;, BTC on big sale. When the price dropped to $400, it was &amp;quot;triple wow, super sale&amp;quot;. But we started to worry, we were out of money. Now we are down to almost $300 and it is &amp;quot;shit, I should buy more, but there is no money left&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. Fundamentals are great. There is good news everywhere. Circle is working. Payment providers are starting to accept Bitcoin. Newegg takes BTC, you can buy plane tickets with BTC, even PayPal is starting to integrate BTC. Yet the price keeps dropping like a rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened. There are two fundamentals working against Bitcoin right now. The first is mining. In the past, most miners were just computer nerds, they had other jobs and held onto most of their coins. They didn&amp;#39;t need to sell. It was an experiment for them. Half of them didn&amp;#39;t even think the concept would work, but it was fun to play with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now mining is done at huge farms. These places have to sell most of their bitcoins. Many are operating at a loss and have to sell all they get. Close to 3600 coins a day are being dumped on the market. The second thing is legacy mining. A lot of people from the old days have huge stockpiles of BTC. They retired. Now they slowly sell them off to pay living expenses. If the price drops in half, no problem, they just sell twice as many, they have thousands, maybe millions left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study previous bubbles. After a bubble, the market tends to form a bowl shaped pattern before the next big jump up in price. There is an all time high of about $1163 on Nov 29, 2013. Now we have a new sustained low of just over $300 on Oct 4, 2014. This is over 10 months. To complete the bowl shape will take at least another 10 months. Then there will be a short flag shape event with high volume as people that bought way back get out. They are just trying to recover their investment. Only after that will there be strong sustained growth (maybe even a new bubble). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you are waiting at least 10 months. That is a 50% probability. A 25% probability that it could be shorter (unexpected whale buying) and a 25% probability (more whales selling) that you will be waiting till 2016. That means a 75% probability that BTC price wont reach $1000 again till near the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we know that Bitcoin makes a lot of stuff obsolete as a store of value. Gold, Art, Land, Offshore Tax Havens. These are all obsolete. Super rich people (the 1%) don&amp;#39;t care though. They control the government. Fiat serves them nicely. They don&amp;#39;t want to support Bitcoin. They support the old system. They will avoid Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for the 99% (us) and we are mostly broke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does this all mean for you as an individual? If you are checking prices every day, you are probably in a state of deep depression. Your wife is telling you to cut your losses and sell. Your mom is hinting that you should attend Gambler&amp;#39;s Anonymous. You dad is disappointed in you. Your friends avoid you. Your kids are asking for their allowance. People call late at night. You have nightmares of Jesse from Breaking Bad busting down your door, holding a gun to your face and saying &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s my money...BIIIITCH&amp;quot;. Suicide hotline numbers are being posted \neverywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do you still have faith? Do you still believe in Bitcoin? If so, it is time for a vacation. Get away from it all. Create a brainwallet, send all your coins there. Get a backpack, collect your toothbrush and some comfortable clothes. Leave a note on the table: &amp;quot;See you in summer of 2016&amp;quot;. Take off. Go hitch-hiking. Live on the beach. Check out the soup kitchens. Go south to warmer weather. If you got the resources, go to Hawaii, it is the best state to be homeless. Why summer of 2016? Bitcoin should recover by then. 90% chance of being over $1200, with a 50% chance of hitting $2000 or higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t check the Bitcoin price till then. Make yourself wait. Read books &amp;amp; magazines at the library, but don&amp;#39;t go online. Don&amp;#39;t even touch a computer, you will be tempted to check, discover the price is still down, and go back to being depressed. You have to go cold turkey. No price checking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do this? Here is the problem with waiting. Half of the stress and anxiety is from all the people that expect you to support them or to pay your bills. They nag and harass you, which causes stress. You are overextend, bitcoin prices are abysmal. You could sell them now and get some relief. But guess what, in a few years bitcoin will recover, but you won&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I know this? Several decades ago, I bought $2000 worth of Microsoft shortly after they went public. That stock is worth over a million dollars now. Do I still have it? No, I sold it to pay rent when it was still worth $2000 (I was unemployed for six months). I supported my family. BTW, that wife abandoned me several years later. I should have just left them and been homeless for a few years. Then I would be a millionaire. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will your family leave you? I don&amp;#39;t know. If they do, you can get another one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to be rich, you have to make it your #1 priority. There is no other way. Most people only get one chance per lifetime. Many don&amp;#39;t even get that. This is your chance. Don&amp;#39;t blow it.  Keep HODLing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

That means a 75% probability that BTC price wont reach $1000 again till near the end of 2015.\n\nYes, we know that Bitcoin makes a lot of stuff obsolete as a store of value. Gold, Art, Land, Offshore Tax Havens. These are all obsolete. Super rich people (the 1%) don't care though. They control the government. Fiat serves them nicely. They don't want to support Bitcoin. They support the old system. They will avoid Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for the 99% (us) and we are mostly broke. \n\nSo what does this all mean for you as an individual? If you are checking prices every day, you are probably in a state of deep depression. Your wife is telling you to cut your losses and sell. Your mom is hinting that you should attend Gambler's Anonymous. You dad is disappointed in you. Your friends avoid you. Your kids are asking for their allowance. People call late at night. You have nightmares of Jesse from Breaking Bad busting down your door, holding a gun to your face and saying \"Where's my money...BIIIITCH\". Suicide hotline numbers are being posted \neverywhere.\n\nSo do you still have faith? Do you still believe in Bitcoin? If so, it is time for a vacation. Get away from it all. Create a brainwallet, send all your coins there. Get a backpack, collect your toothbrush and some comfortable clothes. Leave a note on the table: \"See you in summer of 2016\". Take off. Go hitch-hiking. Live on the beach. Check out the soup kitchens. Go south to warmer weather. If you got the resources, go to Hawaii, it is the best state to be homeless. Why summer of 2016? Bitcoin should recover by then. 90% chance of being over $1200, with a 50% chance of hitting $2000 or higher. \n\nWhatever you do, don't check the Bitcoin price till then. Make yourself wait. Read books &amp; magazines at the library, but don't go online. Don't even touch a computer, you will be tempted to check, discover the price is still down, and go back to being depressed. You have to go cold turkey. No price checking.\n\nWhy do this? Here is the problem with waiting. Half of the stress and anxiety is from all the people that expect you to support them or to pay your bills. They nag and harass you, which causes stress. You are overextend, bitcoin prices are abysmal. You could sell them now and get some relief. But guess what, in a few years bitcoin will recover, but you won't have any.\n\nHow do I know this? Several decades ago, I bought $2000 worth of Microsoft shortly after they went public. That stock is worth over a million dollars now. Do I still have it? No, I sold it to pay rent when it was still worth $2000 (I was unemployed for six months). I supported my family. BTW, that wife abandoned me several years later. I should have just left them and been homeless for a few years. Then I would be a millionaire. \n\nWill your family leave you? I don't know. If they do, you can get another one. \n\nIf you want to be rich, you have to make it your #1 priority. There is no other way. Most people only get one chance per lifetime. Many don't even get that. This is your chance. Don't blow it.  Keep HODLing.\n\n",

I am simply attempting to outline the reasons why there is inherent value in Bitcoins, as well as the risks that come with investing in a crypto-currency. In full disclosure, I personally own and use them, but only a very small portion of my overall portfolio which I would be ok if BTC went to 0 tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been seeing a lot of doom and gloom (as well as irrational exuberance) in a lot of posts lately, and a lot of people saying this or that with no evidence or fundamentals to back up their claims. So I wanted to put my thoughts and experiences [more about me below] out there in the hopes that people actually serious about utilizing Bitcoins (BTC from here on) might find this information helpful, as well as to connect with and solicit thoughts from anybody else that’s done research on the future of BTC. Also &lt;strong&gt;mods:&lt;/strong&gt; I searched through old posts and the FAQ but couldn’t really find anything like this, so let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post this. I can also add hyperlinked sources to this to make it a reference document if there is interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary/tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; The fundamentals underlying the intrinsic value of Bitcoins haven’t changed. In fact, they continue to improve day-by-day, as merchant and user adoption increases. As long as this trend continues, and certain risk factors - see below - are minimized, BTC will eventually become widely accepted as a currency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;That being said&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you should never “invest” more money than you are willing to completely lose, or money that you would otherwise need for living expenses. Otherwise, you are gambling. (I put “invest” in quotes because I believe BTC are currently far too speculative to be considered an “investment.” This may change in the future, but the technology is still so new, and there are so many unknowns, that it should not be considered anything more than a speculative investment at this point.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This has happened before and it will happen again:&lt;/strong&gt; This week hasn’t been good for those holding Bitcoins. In fact, if you invested in BTC anytime in the past year, I’d say it’s been a pretty shitty year, period. But the thing is, we’ve seen this type of thing in financial markets before, almost exactly to a t, and how they tend to play out. There have been various bubbles of all shapes and sizes throughout history, and the run-up in prices earlier this year, was no exception. However, unlike the critics, I believe BTCs are different, as there is significant intrinsic value in the BTC network and BTC as a value store - which I outline below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also think it’s useless to speculate about the direction of BTC in the short to medium-term (I would argue the price adjustment has been a good thing for the long-term), so to me the only meaningful way to analyze what’s going on is to examine the fundamentals (apologies if a lot of this is basic, but I wanted to cover all the key points as I saw them):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Value:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currency As a Store of Value:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A currency has value because the holders of it believe it has value. This might seem like a paradox, but it is how fiat currencies (namely, the USD and every other major currency in the world) function, and BTC is no different. As the number of people owning and using BTC increases, the relative value of BTC will have to grow as the supply is limited to 21million BTC (to use an economics analogy: In this case, we can’t find more seashells, we can only break the ones we have into smaller pieces).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if user adoption were to plateau or decrease?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Even if growth were to stop today, and not a single more person in the world were to use BTC than already are, there would still be value assigned to them by those who currently hold, which is reflected in the BTC/USD rate. There is already value there by virtue of the number of people that own it and merchants that accept it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of me writing this, there are an estimated 1.2million BTC holders on ledgers worldwide. This number is greater than the population of many countries that have their own currency. I believe BTC are past the point where people should question the viability of BTC as a store of value, and instead look at BTC for the value it provides for the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worldwide Transaction Network:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In my analysis, this represents the true potential value of BTC. Think of the major credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX) - they’re accepted pretty much anywhere right? You can walk into almost any shop throughout the world, and as long as you hold one of these cards, the merchant will trade you his/her goods and services for a portion of what you’ve got in your account. And this is &lt;strong&gt;hugely&lt;/strong&gt; valuable. To the tune of $Billions per year these companies make in profit, all because of the network of merchants that accept them worldwide. But one thing that people might forget is these companies had to grow their merchant network, just like BTC, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, this to me represents the primary growth potential of BTC. I’ve seen estimates that 10,000 retailers are currently accepting them, and there are some pretty big names in the list (Overstock, Target, eBay via PayPal, CVS). As the number of places that accept BTC increase, so does the intrinsic value. This also has a compounding, even self-fulfilling, effect: as the number of places that accept BTC increases, the value increases, thus more merchants are willing to accept BTC as a currency because it has value…chew on that for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Growing BTC Eco-system:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is represented by the growing number of Bitcoin-related venture startups and websites/wallets/apps that support BTC transactions. There is a network effect here, and as long as people are invested into it, will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security/Anonymity/Ease of Transaction:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I think most of us are familiar with BTC security measures (how important the password to your wallet/account is), how the hashes are generated by an algorithm that cannot be faked (essentially counterfeit-proof), and low transaction costs. These are all pluses that make the currency attractive as a value store, with some caveats listed in the “Risks” section below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hedge Against Fiat Currencies:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is a two-edged sword. I think there’s a lot of investment in BTC because of the fear of overactive Central Banks inflating other currencies (again, namely the USD), but as we saw this week, this can work against BTC. I explain more later below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I’ve briefly outlined above some pretty clear reasons why there is inherent value in BTC, and the reasons why I personally am optimistic about the long-term future and will continue to use them. That being said, I’ve also identified &lt;strong&gt;several primary risk factors&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; me as a long-term investor, ones that all holders of BTC should be aware of. Please, if you know or can think of any others, reply or PM me so I can add them to this list:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Risks:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continued market volatility:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Price volatility might be good for day-traders, but for a currency, it’s killer. As described above, one of the core elements a currency must have is as a store of value, and if the price fluctuates wildly from day-to-day, merchants (and currency owners) will be less willing to accept it. Who would want to hold currency that’s worth 1/2 of what it was last week? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also a reason why it’s essential for the currency to have a limited supply (or perception thereof), or else rampant inflation would occur - look at Zimbabwe. The bottom-line is, if the USD (US Dollar) were to drop 25% in one week, like we saw with BTC this week, it would indicate a complete economic collapse was occurring. Faith in the currency would be destroyed, and it would take extreme measures to preserve it. It’s actually kind of a small miracle BTC hasn’t completely collapsed, but I think it’s because (1) there is real value in it, and (2) BTC are not widely used yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The remedy for this is there has to be either (1) a large holder of the currency that is able to inject or take out some currency to keep the price stable -- if you look at the US Federal Reserve this is one of its two primary mandates, or (2) the number of BTC owners has to reach a saturation “tipping point” where enough people are utilizing the currency for day-to-day transactions, and not for speculative reasons. I don’t believe we’re quite at this point yet, but getting there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Governmental regulation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is a big unknown for me, and with recent news that Russia and China have prohibited use of BTCs, presumably in the effort to curb illegal transactions, could become a trend. However, to address people who are concerned about this, I would make the following points:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the reason for government regulation? Is it to curb illegal activity transacted in BTC? If this is the case, there is plenty of illegal activity being transacted in US Dollars, Russian Rubles, gold coins, jewelry, etc… What makes BTC special? If the reason is to prohibit a competing national currency, then that is a separate legal issue which will have to be resolved, but probably not until far in the future. In the US, a case like this would almost definitely go to the Supreme Court for clarification.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Which government agency should have regulatory authority? In more democratic societies (than Russia and China) that have a strong rule of law (most of the rest of the western world), government agencies can’t simply do something because they want to (unfortunately the trend is changing even in the US). There has to be a legal jurisdiction or precedence that would allow this, and because crypto-currencies are so new, none has been set. For example, just look at how long it took most state governments to start taxing Amazon purchases. I used to live in Virginia, and they just started in Dec 2013, almost 20 years after Amazon was founded…&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How would governments enforce restrictions? Would it be by imposing fines on merchants that accept the crypto-currencies? Legally, how is this different than restricting payment in gold or silver then, or Craigslist transactions?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ease of use:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; BTC are not quite easy enough to use where the average person will find it appealing. I think a lot of companies are working to address this (e.g. the hardest part of signing up on Coinbase was remembering my password), so to me this risk is what we can do the most about, but still a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loss potential:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If you forget or lose your password, you’re SOL at this point. But this isn’t really different from losing cash on the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Market Cornering(added):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; There is the possibility a large percentage of the total available BTC are owned by a handful of individuals. For example, it is estimated that &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto\"&gt;Satoshi&lt;/a&gt; alone owns ~1 million BTC. In the event that one or more of these owners were to attempt to &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market\"&gt;corner the BTC market&lt;/a&gt; there could be extreme price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current overall valuation may be a bit high:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Back of the napkin calculation follows-&lt;br/&gt;\nTotal valuation of BTC = (# of BTC available) x (current price/BTC)&lt;br/&gt;\nTotal valuation of BTC = ~13million x $330 = ~$4billion&lt;br/&gt;\n$4 billion of perceived value is probably high for as small as the BTC network currently is. But, this number is reflective of the high growth rate in the number of users/owners and merchants that have accepted BTC. In other words, this may be a fair price. And, by definition, it is technically the actual fair price since it is, after all, an actual currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but those are the major value and risk factors I see. If you have anything to add, please feel free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in the context of everything I said above, I’d like to talk about what happened this week in particular:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this week’s price movement (as of me writing this, has been a 25% drop) is a result of several factors:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29445335\"&gt;News that US Dollar is very strong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Capitulation: I don’t have the ability to do Technical Analysis on BTC right now, but just eyeing the &lt;a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/price/#2013-10-04,2014-10-04,close,bpi,USD\"&gt;1-year chart&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like $400 was a key support point for the price of BTC. Once it broke through that, psychological barriers were broken and selling cascaded.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/russia-proposes-fines-bitcoin/\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and China potentially banning BTC&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. That’s all I can find about Bitcoins in the news.

          "selftext": "***Disclaimer:*** *This post is not an endorsement to either buy or sell Bitcoins. I am simply attempting to outline the reasons why there is inherent value in Bitcoins, as well as the risks that come with investing in a crypto-currency. In full disclosure, I personally own and use them, but only a very small portion of my overall portfolio which I would be ok if BTC went to 0 tomorrow.*\n\n**Purpose:** I’ve been seeing a lot of doom and gloom (as well as irrational exuberance) in a lot of posts lately, and a lot of people saying this or that with no evidence or fundamentals to back up their claims. So I wanted to put my thoughts and experiences [more about me below] out there in the hopes that people actually serious about utilizing Bitcoins (BTC from here on) might find this information helpful, as well as to connect with and solicit thoughts from anybody else that’s done research on the future of BTC. Also **mods:** I searched through old posts and the FAQ but couldn’t really find anything like this, so let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post this. I can also add hyperlinked sources to this to make it a reference document if there is interest.\n\n**Summary/tl;dr:** The fundamentals underlying the intrinsic value of Bitcoins haven’t changed. In fact, they continue to improve day-by-day, as merchant and user adoption increases. As long as this trend continues, and certain risk factors - see below - are minimized, BTC will eventually become widely accepted as a currency.\n\n***That being said***, you should never “invest” more money than you are willing to completely lose, or money that you would otherwise need for living expenses. Otherwise, you are gambling. (I put “invest” in quotes because I believe BTC are currently far too speculative to be considered an “investment.” This may change in the future, but the technology is still so new, and there are so many unknowns, that it should not be considered anything more than a speculative investment at this point.)\n\n**This has happened before and it will happen again:** This week hasn’t been good for those holding Bitcoins. In fact, if you invested in BTC anytime in the past year, I’d say it’s been a pretty shitty year, period. But the thing is, we’ve seen this type of thing in financial markets before, almost exactly to a t, and how they tend to play out. There have been various bubbles of all shapes and sizes throughout history, and the run-up in prices earlier this year, was no exception. However, unlike the critics, I believe BTCs are different, as there is significant intrinsic value in the BTC network and BTC as a value store - which I outline below.\n\nI also think it’s useless to speculate about the direction of BTC in the short to medium-term (I would argue the price adjustment has been a good thing for the long-term), so to me the only meaningful way to analyze what’s going on is to examine the fundamentals (apologies if a lot of this is basic, but I wanted to cover all the key points as I saw them):\n\n\n\n### Value:\n\n* ***Currency As a Store of Value:*** A currency has value because the holders of it believe it has value. This might seem like a paradox, but it is how fiat currencies (namely, the USD and every other major currency in the world) function, and BTC is no different. As the number of people owning and using BTC increases, the relative value of BTC will have to grow as the supply is limited to 21million BTC (to use an economics analogy: In this case, we can’t find more seashells, we can only break the ones we have into smaller pieces).\n\n    ***What if user adoption were to plateau or decrease?*** Even if growth were to stop today, and not a single more person in the world were to use BTC than already are, there would still be value assigned to them by those who currently hold, which is reflected in the BTC/USD rate. There is already value there by virtue of the number of people that own it and merchants that accept it.\n\n    As of me writing this, there are an estimated 1.2million BTC holders on ledgers worldwide. This number is greater than the population of many countries that have their own currency. I believe BTC are past the point where people should question the viability of BTC as a store of value, and instead look at BTC for the value it provides for the following reasons.\n\n* ***Worldwide Transaction Network:*** In my analysis, this represents the true potential value of BTC. Think of the major credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX) - they’re accepted pretty much anywhere right? You can walk into almost any shop throughout the world, and as long as you hold one of these cards, the merchant will trade you his/her goods and services for a portion of what you’ve got in your account. And this is **hugely** valuable. To the tune of $Billions per year these companies make in profit, all because of the network of merchants that accept them worldwide. But one thing that people might forget is these companies had to grow their merchant network, just like BTC, one at a time.\n\n    Thus, this to me represents the primary growth potential of BTC. I’ve seen estimates that 10,000 retailers are currently accepting them, and there are some pretty big names in the list (Overstock, Target, eBay via PayPal, CVS). As the number of places that accept BTC increase, so does the intrinsic value. This also has a compounding, even self-fulfilling, effect: as the number of places that accept BTC increases, the value increases, thus more merchants are willing to accept BTC as a currency because it has value…chew on that for a second.\n\n* ***Growing BTC Eco-system:*** This is represented by the growing number of Bitcoin-related venture startups and websites/wallets/apps that support BTC transactions. There is a network effect here, and as long as people are invested into it, will continue to grow.\n\n* ***Security/Anonymity/Ease of Transaction:*** I think most of us are familiar with BTC security measures (how important the password to your wallet/account is), how the hashes are generated by an algorithm that cannot be faked (essentially counterfeit-proof), and low transaction costs. These are all pluses that make the currency attractive as a value store, with some caveats listed in the “Risks” section below.\n\n* ***Hedge Against Fiat Currencies:*** This is a two-edged sword. I think there’s a lot of investment in BTC because of the fear of overactive Central Banks inflating other currencies (again, namely the USD), but as we saw this week, this can work against BTC. I explain more later below. \n\nSo I’ve briefly outlined above some pretty clear reasons why there is inherent value in BTC, and the reasons why I personally am optimistic about the long-term future and will continue to use them. That being said, I’ve also identified **several primary risk factors** that ***worry*** me as a long-term investor, ones that all holders of BTC should be aware of. Please, if you know or can think of any others, reply or PM me so I can add them to this list:\n\n\n\n### Risks:\n\n* ***Continued market volatility:*** Price volatility might be good for day-traders, but for a currency, it’s killer. As described above, one of the core elements a currency must have is as a store of value, and if the price fluctuates wildly from day-to-day, merchants (and currency owners) will be less willing to accept it. Who would want to hold currency that’s worth 1/2 of what it was last week? \n\n    This is also a reason why it’s essential for the currency to have a limited supply (or perception thereof), or else rampant inflation would occur - look at Zimbabwe. The bottom-line is, if the USD (US Dollar) were to drop 25% in one week, like we saw with BTC this week, it would indicate a complete economic collapse was occurring. Faith in the currency would be destroyed, and it would take extreme measures to preserve it. It’s actually kind of a small miracle BTC hasn’t completely collapsed, but I think it’s because (1) there is real value in it, and (2) BTC are not widely used yet.\n\n    The remedy for this is there has to be either (1) a large holder of the currency that is able to inject or take out some currency to keep the price stable -- if you look at the US Federal Reserve this is one of its two primary mandates, or (2) the number of BTC owners has to reach a saturation “tipping point” where enough people are utilizing the currency for day-to-day transactions, and not for speculative reasons. I don’t believe we’re quite at this point yet, but getting there.\n\n* ***Governmental regulation:*** This is a big unknown for me, and with recent news that Russia and China have prohibited use of BTCs, presumably in the effort to curb illegal transactions, could become a trend. However, to address people who are concerned about this, I would make the following points:\n    1. What is the reason for government regulation? Is it to curb illegal activity transacted in BTC? If this is the case, there is plenty of illegal activity being transacted in US Dollars, Russian Rubles, gold coins, jewelry, etc… What makes BTC special? If the reason is to prohibit a competing national currency, then that is a separate legal issue which will have to be resolved, but probably not until far in the future. In the US, a case like this would almost definitely go to the Supreme Court for clarification.\n    2. Which government agency should have regulatory authority? In more democratic societies (than Russia and China) that have a strong rule of law (most of the rest of the western world), government agencies can’t simply do something because they want to (unfortunately the trend is changing even in the US). There has to be a legal jurisdiction or precedence that would allow this, and because crypto-currencies are so new, none has been set. For example, just look at how long it took most state governments to start taxing Amazon purchases. I used to live in Virginia, and they just started in Dec 2013, almost 20 years after Amazon was founded…\n    3. How would governments enforce restrictions? Would it be by imposing fines on merchants that accept the crypto-currencies? Legally, how is this different than restricting payment in gold or silver then, or Craigslist transactions?\n \n* ***Ease of use:*** BTC are not quite easy enough to use where the average person will find it appealing. I think a lot of companies are working to address this (e.g. the hardest part of signing up on Coinbase was remembering my password), so to me this risk is what we can do the most about, but still a concern.\n\n* ***Loss potential:*** If you forget or lose your password, you’re SOL at this point. But this isn’t really different from losing cash on the street.\n\n* ***Market Cornering(added):*** There is the possibility a large percentage of the total available BTC are owned by a handful of individuals. For example, it is estimated that [Satoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) alone owns ~1 million BTC. In the event that one or more of these owners were to attempt to [corner the BTC market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market) there could be extreme price volatility.\n\n* ***Current overall valuation may be a bit high:*** Back of the napkin calculation follows-    \n    Total valuation of BTC = (# of BTC available) x (current price/BTC)    \n    Total valuation of BTC = ~13million x $330 = ~$4billion    \n$4 billion of perceived value is probably high for as small as the BTC network currently is. But, this number is reflective of the high growth rate in the number of users/owners and merchants that have accepted BTC. In other words, this may be a fair price. And, by definition, it is technically the actual fair price since it is, after all, an actual currency.\n\nI could go on, but those are the major value and risk factors I see. If you have anything to add, please feel free.\n\n\n**So, in the context of everything I said above, I’d like to talk about what happened this week in particular:** \n\nI believe this week’s price movement (as of me writing this, has been a 25% drop) is a result of several factors:\n\n1. [News that US Dollar is very strong](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29445335)\n2. Capitulation: I don’t have the ability to do Technical Analysis on BTC right now, but just eyeing the [1-year chart](http://www.coindesk.com/price/#2013-10-04,2014-10-04,close,bpi,USD), it looks like $400 was a key support point for the price of BTC. Once it broke through that, psychological barriers were broken and selling cascaded.\n3. [Russia](http://www.coindesk.com/russia-proposes-fines-bitcoin/) and China potentially banning BTC\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s all I can find about Bitcoins in the news. The value fundamentals I listed have not changed one bit, and if anything, the rate of user adoption has increased as more people are [learning](http://avc.com/2014/09/video-of-the-week-fred-ehrsams-bitcoin-presentation/)\n [what](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238103)\n [it is](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11138581/Bitcoin-will-become-the-new-gold.html).\n\nWhich is why I’m excited about the future of BTC. It’s a product that I use and like, and see tremendous value for. This week’s sell-off just means I can buy more.\n\n\n**About me:** \n\nIn a past life, I was an equity research analyst responsible for due diligence, fundamental/technical analysis, and making recommendations to the PM on which stocks a certain mutual fund should buy or sell. This meant reading through a **lot** of annual reports, financial statements, 10-K, 10-Q, shareholder calls, etc… My primary influences were Warren Buffett, Philip Fisher, and Ben Graham.

This is essentially how Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway and became the world’s richest man (for a short period); his strategy has since greatly evolved, but this was the core philosophy he used for a long time.\n\n\n^1 Utilizing this strategy, our fund bought a significant stake in AAPL when the price per share was less than the amount of **cash** per share the company currently held (split adjusted something like ~$2 per share when we bought).

By 2020 were expected to double internet penetration worldwide. Besides Bitcoin can work by sms, and radio.  The unbanked represent at least $1.3 trillion dollers. For many of these 3rd world people, having a cellphone is cheaper than having a bank account. To put this into perspective they have a cellphone, but it&amp;#39;s difficult to obtain clean drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also opens up international commerce in a way that we have never had due to credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin opens up international commerce like we have never seen.\nA big feature is for people who live in countries where credit card fraud is higher. If you live in, say, Ukraine and want to order something from the states (or even from within Ukraine), it is a huge deal when it is even possible to complete a transaction because merchants can&amp;#39;t trust that the transaction isn&amp;#39;t with stolen cards. Bitcoins irreversibility mitigates this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &amp;quot;You have significantly reduced transaction costs compared to converting one international currency to another international currency -- it&amp;#39;s typically cheaper.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t matter if the price of a Bitcoin was $10 dollers, it would still fun coino correctly for commerce, etc. Besides, there are services coming which will supposedly allow you to lock in your &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; allowing people the ability to avoid any volatility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the 21 million units are purchased by people, that&amp;#39;s it, you will see the price reflect that, eventually. By 2020 93% of all bitcoins will exist, which also correlates with data on future Internet adoption rates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are you selling based upon anyways, the price? Did you buy based upon only the price, or the possibilities of the technology. Nothing has changed, the startups have received money already and are still building the services. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time you sell successfully, someone else now obviously believes the opposite of you and is buying. They are either day trading, or holding, pick one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;#39;m telling you this because I want you to remain faithful. I don&amp;#39;t want the price to drop. I want it to remain stable, it makes Bitcoin look good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a video reminder of Mark Andreessen on bitcoins long term potential: \n&lt;a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000279168\"&gt;http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000279168&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/rant. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Bitcoins irreversibility mitigates this problem.\n\nAdditionally, \"You have significantly reduced transaction costs compared to converting one international currency to another international currency -- it's typically cheaper.\"\n\nIt wouldn't matter if the price of a Bitcoin was $10 dollers, it would still fun coino correctly for commerce, etc. Besides, there are services coming which will supposedly allow you to lock in your \"value\" allowing people the ability to avoid any volatility. \n\nWhen the 21 million units are purchased by people, that's it, you will see the price reflect that, eventually. By 2020 93% of all bitcoins will exist, which also correlates with data on future Internet adoption rates. \n\nWhat are you selling based upon anyways, the price? Did you buy based upon only the price, or the possibilities of the technology. Nothing has changed, the startups have received money already and are still building the services. \n\nEvery time you sell successfully, someone else now obviously believes the opposite of you and is buying. They are either day trading, or holding, pick one.\n\nOf course I'm telling you this because I want you to remain faithful. I don't want the price to drop. I want it to remain stable, it makes Bitcoin look good.\n\nJust a video reminder of Mark Andreessen on bitcoins long term potential: \nhttp://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000279168\n\n\n\n/rant. ",

I am interested to know if anything like this has been proposed before, I think it would have major advantages for the adoption of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was initially trying to think of how to solve the problem of needing to move coins when the private key wasn&amp;#39;t available, such as if someone lost them, or even if the owner died, although that in itself isn&amp;#39;t a widespread problem, I think that what I came up with has larger benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the solution is not going to allow arbitrary raids on other peoples Bitcoin addresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution is for the person who owns the wallet to generate additional secondary keys, either when the wallet is first created or at any time later. These secondary keys are distinct from the primary key that controls the wallet and can safely be given to people you might (or might not) trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like regular keys the secondary keys could be used to sign a transaction and move coins on behalf of the address. However, the transactions signed by these keys would be distinct, and nodes would recognize that the transaction has been signed by a secondary key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When such a transaction was relayed it would be written into the blockchain like normal, however, like newly mined coins, the output coins from the transaction would not be spendable for a significant number of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this stage a few things could have happened:-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The genuine owner of the wallet lost their private keys. They went to their trusted friend and told them about the loss, the friend helped them recover their funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The genuine owner of the wallet died. The coins were moved by a relative or solicitor who had been trusted with a secondary key. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Someone who had been trusted with the key went rogue and decided to steal the coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the new transaction is initially recorded in the blockchain it will be publicly visible. At this point, if the person who owns the wallet is still around then they should be able to get an alert, triggered by the visibility of the new transaction on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the owner did not want the transaction to go through, then they could sign a different transaction with their own primary key to move the coins to a new wallet, or write a command to the blockchain to cancel the original transaction and render the outputs from the transaction that was signed by the secondary key to &amp;#39;permanently immature&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;dead&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the owner of the wallet wanted the transaction to happen then they would just do nothing. Eventually the coins moved by the secondary keys would mature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the coins were moved by a primary key before they had matured from being moved by the secondary key, then the Bitcoin system would have to realize this and not allow the coins moved by the secondary key to mature, ever. Clearly this requires big changes to existing software and would increase &amp;#39;spam&amp;#39; on the blockchain as all failed transactions would be recorded permanently on the blockchain, it would be appropriate for someone using a secondary key to pay a miners fee from their own wallet that would mature regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would all allow a user to generate additional keys to give out to friends who might be able to help in case of difficulty or to family, solicitors, etc. And not have to worry that they could run off with all their coins. An additional feature could be added that would encode other information into the keys other than that they were primary or secondary. Perhaps the key is only allowed to send a certain volume of transactions or the time it takes for the outputs to mature varies by key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this was developed then it could also fix a criticism about Bitcoin that I quite frequently see, that it does not have a feature like direct debits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For many of us, the fact that another organisation cannot simply dip into our wallets and take our money is a huge bonus that Bitcoin offers over traditional banking systems. It can not be denied however that this does lead to an increased inconvenience when trying to use Bitcoin for every day life and a reluctance of organisations like utility companies to accept Bitcoin. A secondary key as described could be issued for a wallet and be given to another entity such as an energy or water supplier, as long as the owner of the wallet was reasonably pro-active in watching out for payment alerts, then there is no risk of the utility company running away with the funds. I am thinking that a typical &amp;#39;maturing time&amp;#39; specified for a secondary key that was given to the water company would be something like 14 31 days, if Bitcoin were to be used as a daily fact of life then we might assume that people would have ample opportunity to spot the cancellable payments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to somehow being encoded in the key, the info about the limits of the new key could be written into the blockchain at the time the key is created, probably a miners fee would have to be paid. When the key was used nodes would check that it was acting within its limits in terms of potentially many variables: Date ranges the key is valid for, transaction limits, frequency limits and receiver address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a big advantage to Bitcoin if it allowed for direct-debit like features and I could see a lot more organisations and major companies accepting it as a valid payment method. Utility companies would be able to be fairly sure that the person was &amp;#39;good&amp;#39; for the money even if they might yet cancel it, and would continue to provide service in faith that the transaction would eventually mature. This is pretty much what happens anyway as most banks will allow for the reversal of a direct debit by the sending account holder and as such if this feature was implemented in Bitcoin then it would sit fairly well with existing processes. People would not worry about having to pay their bills while they were on holiday and companies would get their regular payments without needing to get an account holder to actively do anything (traditionally very difficult) as long as the sender still had the funds.

Note they pay 15cents to 40cents a kw/h in most of these big farms apparently.\n\nNow.  No panic.  Let them drive eachother out of business, and have innovation render all their hardware obsolete. they are leeches, and have nothing to contribute to the system, other than a BIG SUCKING SOUND.  This won't take long.  \n\nSo don't worry, but i think price is going lower until they close up shop.  I on the other hand, who lives in a cold place (at least in winter), has a quite frankly, smart system that i'd like to share with you.\n\nI heat my garage with bitcoin miners.  thats it.  Imagine all those people that actually buy garage heaters for winter had bitcoin miners....i mean....i pay 5-7c a kw/h, so really i heat my garage (and it heats up the floor above it) and i have bitcoin left over to replace my equipment when it becomes obsolete.  or i could run obsolete equipment, it will still turn a profit if it has a dual purpose as a heater.  \n\nsomeone smart could sell an ethernet/wifi controlled garage heater....installed in every home...decentralize....\n\nmy 2 cents.  \n\nedit: or you know, the russian ban thingy, whatever",

Valuing it similarly, based on price point alone, therefore is likely to result in mistakes. Things like stocks or Ponzi item inventories are traded in a market and derive a price, but unlike Bitcoin the total units available to the market is basically fixed. People trade a relatively static supply of these and it&amp;#39;s up to new entrants to enter the market along with other dynamics like sentiment to result in price increases. Bitcoin, however, doesn&amp;#39;t have a static supply for the market. By design the units available are inflationary, because Bitcoin is a &lt;em&gt;currency&lt;/em&gt;. What makes a currency valuable is how many people use it, not what the sentiment on it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a better way to gauge how well Bitcoin is doing is to &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt; the number of currency units in any analysis. Doing that paints a very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using these two sources I derive some interesting numbers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=1year&amp;amp;showDataPoints=true&amp;amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;amp;show_header=true&amp;amp;scale=0&amp;amp;address=\"&gt;https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=1year&amp;amp;showDataPoints=true&amp;amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;amp;show_header=true&amp;amp;scale=0&amp;amp;address=&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv\"&gt;http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following shows Bitcoin price points multiplied by total coins in existence at 1 year intervals, to find a &lt;em&gt;total market cap&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$12 * 10,091,000 =  121 million.....Oct &amp;#39;12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$120 * 11,790,000 = 1.4 billion.....Oct &amp;#39;13  (1057% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$350 * 13,341,000 = 4.66 billion....Oct &amp;#39;14  (232% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$? * 14,650,000 = 6.99 billion........Oct &amp;#39;15  (50% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see the &lt;em&gt;market cap&lt;/em&gt; of Bitcoin is doing extremely well. Wall St. traders would love such yearly increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice for Oct &amp;#39;15 I project a 50% increase. Why? It&amp;#39;s because I expect the trend to be up, but as many may have heard by now it&amp;#39;s generally expected for Bitcoin&amp;#39;s volatility to lessen as time goes on and the market grows larger (making it more useful as a currency). The numbers above show that - the market is finding equlibrium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given this we can solve for and predict what Bitcoin&amp;#39;s price should be in Oct &amp;#39;15, which in this case is $477.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. I rarely make speculative predictions, but this is mine for the next year. If you bought in over $500 my advice is to hold. I think there is a good chance you&amp;#39;ll recover your money after a year. If you&amp;#39;re looking to get into Bitcoin my advice is to buy, and there is a good chance you&amp;#39;ll make at least 50% on your money in 1 year (not bad by Wall St. standards).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But.. but... but I thought I was going to be RICH!?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, you may be. I depends how many bitcoins you have. Indeed, Bitcoin has already made many of its users rich. That story may not be over either. Why? Well for that we need a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; kind of chart:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://blog.betable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle-1.png\"&gt;http://blog.betable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle-1.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what&amp;#39;s known as a technology adoption curve. It&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve seen happen over and over again with different technologies, other than Bitcoin. This shows all the fantastic growth we&amp;#39;ve seen in Bitcoin, all the 3,000% increases, news, attention etc. is only a precursor of what&amp;#39;s to come, because we&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; in the early adopter stage. If you don&amp;#39;t think so ask your local grocer if they own any bitcoins, or even if any of their friends do. Until that answer is yes, we&amp;#39;re not out of the early adopter stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is something else, though. That&amp;#39;s a chart specifically for &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;. Bitcoin isn&amp;#39;t only a new technology. It&amp;#39;s a new &lt;em&gt;currency&lt;/em&gt; - a global one. We simply don&amp;#39;t have any good charts or data on what happens when the global population begins to adopt the same new currency. The closest thing to that would be the US dollar, the world&amp;#39;s reserve currency, and obviously that&amp;#39;s something measured in the trillions, not the millions or billions Bitcoin markets are measured in now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the 477 price target is only based on the market trying to find equilibrium with what Bitcoin is today, not what it becomes in the future, which can look very different than what it is today. Markets seek equilibrium. That&amp;#39;s what they do. So don&amp;#39;t despair about day to day price point gains or losses. In the grand scheme of things Bitcoin is right on target.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Doing that paints a very different picture.\n\nUsing these two sources I derive some interesting numbers:\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=1year&amp;showDataPoints=true&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=\n\nhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv\n\nThe following shows Bitcoin price points multiplied by total coins in existence at 1 year intervals, to find a *total market cap*.\n\n$12 * 10,091,000 =  121 million.....Oct '12\n\n$120 * 11,790,000 = 1.4 billion.....Oct '13  (1057% increase)\n\n$350 * 13,341,000 = 4.66 billion....Oct '14  (232% increase)\n\n$? * 14,650,000 = 6.99 billion........Oct '15  (50% increase)\n\nAs you can see the *market cap* of Bitcoin is doing extremely well. Wall St. traders would love such yearly increases.\n\nNotice for Oct '15 I project a 50% increase. Why? It's because I expect the trend to be up, but as many may have heard by now it's generally expected for Bitcoin's volatility to lessen as time goes on and the market grows larger (making it more useful as a currency). The numbers above show that - the market is finding equlibrium.\n\nGiven this we can solve for and predict what Bitcoin's price should be in Oct '15, which in this case is $477.\n\nSo there you have it. I rarely make speculative predictions, but this is mine for the next year. If you bought in over $500 my advice is to hold. I think there is a good chance you'll recover your money after a year. If you're looking to get into Bitcoin my advice is to buy, and there is a good chance you'll make at least 50% on your money in 1 year (not bad by Wall St. standards).\n\nBut.. but... but I thought I was going to be RICH!?!\n\nWell, you may be. I depends how many bitcoins you have. Indeed, Bitcoin has already made many of its users rich. That story may not be over either. Why? Well for that we need a *different* kind of chart:\n\nhttp://blog.betable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle-1.png\n\nThis is what's known as a technology adoption curve. It's what we've seen happen over and over again with different technologies, other than Bitcoin. This shows all the fantastic growth we've seen in Bitcoin, all the 3,000% increases, news, attention etc. is only a precursor of what's to come, because we're *still* in the early adopter stage. If you don't think so ask your local grocer if they own any bitcoins, or even if any of their friends do. Until that answer is yes, we're not out of the early adopter stage.\n\nThere is something else, though. That's a chart specifically for *technology*. Bitcoin isn't only a new technology. It's a new *currency* - a global one. We simply don't have any good charts or data on what happens when the global population begins to adopt the same new currency. The closest thing to that would be the US dollar, the world's reserve currency, and obviously that's something measured in the trillions, not the millions or billions Bitcoin markets are measured in now.\n\nSo the 477 price target is only based on the market trying to find equilibrium with what Bitcoin is today, not what it becomes in the future, which can look very different than what it is today. Markets seek equilibrium. That's what they do. So don't despair about day to day price point gains or losses. In the grand scheme of things Bitcoin is right on target.",
