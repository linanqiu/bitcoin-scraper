If someone knew for certain (such that they were going to donate to the campaign and ensure it's full funding) they could perhaps profit from these secondary markets of pledged coins. \n\nI'm not entirely sure what this could all mean for the campaigns, and everythng else but it seems like if bitcoin and dominant assurance contracts take off it would result in this sort trading and behavior. \n\nWhat sort of implications might this have? Would it make it more difficult or easier to successfully get crowdfunding? Would it lead to better or worse allocation of funding or wealth to useful and potentially successful projects?\n\n\nUseful links if you aren't familiar with DACs:\nhttp://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/08/a-test-of-dominant-assurance-contracts.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_contract#Dominant_assurance_contracts\n\n\n\n",

Bitcoin is \nbetter than currency in that you don't have to be physically in the same place and\nof course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers\nwe're talking about aren't trying to be anonymous. You know they're willing to\nbe known so the Bitcoin technology is key and you could add to it or you could\nbuild a similar technology where there's enough attribution that people feel\ncomfortable that this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering.\n\nThanks to one of our CEOs here's the link: http://www.bloomberg.com/video/bill-gates-bitcoin-is-exciting-because-it-s-cheap-dQ4qHV4~TLSnUIuIRfZBVA.html\n\n",

About a year ago we started development of NGCCC, which later became known as ChromaWallet. Currently we're working on JS-based colored coins platform which would serve as a basis for mobile and web wallets.\n\nWe're being guided by following principles:\n\n * Wallet software should not rely on trust and should do all the processing locally (when possible).\n * Wallet software should be accessible to all kinds of users, available on multiple platforms, and shouldn't require complex/lengthy installation procedure.\n * We aim to provide a toolkit for various colored coin applications rather than just a wallet.\n\nAnd thus we implemented modular JS libraries which form a complete colored coins wallet, but can also be used in a variety of applications involving colored coins.\n\nThere are three libraries offering different levels of abstraction:\n\n1. [coloredcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/chromaway/coloredcoinjs-lib) is low-level. You can ask it about colorvalues of transaction outputs, and it can also construct transactions, but you have to provide inputs yourself. This is probably what you should use if you want add colored coins support to an existing wallet.\n2. [cc-wallet-core](https://github.com/chromaway/cc-wallet-core) implements a complete wallet, taking care of everything from keypairs to pushing transactions to the network.\n3. [cc-wallet-engine](https://github.com/chromaway/cc-wallet-engine) offers a high-level interface on top of cc-wallet-core. It takes care of low-level details, such as amount formatting.\n\nSo if you want to make your own colored coins wallet, you can grab cc-wallet-engine and add UI on top of it. Our sample UI implementation is [here](https://github.com/chromaway/chromawallet-proto).\n\nIn the current stage, we have a working wallet, which is able to send and receive coins, but we are still working on some improvements in fixes.\n\nAnd a bit about applications, colored coins can be used for a wide variety of things, like alternative payment systems (cc-USD), commodity trading, capital markets, vouchers, authentication tokens, smart property and so on.\n\nInitially (2 years ago) we were working on one-size-fits-all kind of a wallet, but clearly one wallet can't be optimal for everything.\n\nOn the next iteration (NGCCC), we split implementation into two libraries (coloredcoinlib and ngcccbase) and UI (ChromaWallet, that is), so support of various applications was something which we had in mind.
