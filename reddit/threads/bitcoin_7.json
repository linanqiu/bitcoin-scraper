Option (1) involves transferring REAL money to other exchanges, perhaps in another country. Obviously, it is much easier to move coins from my wallets than transfer money from my company bank account to other exchanges (which needs to bypass accounting audits, requires currency conversion, and imposes huge transaction fees and delay). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Audit and proof of solvency does not solve this problem, because an audit only proves that an exchange has enough coins at that time.

I thought this would be ok, since I was giving it back to the btc community\n\n(So, I saw something similar to this a while ago, but apparently there was no payload at the end.)\n\n\ntl;dr I wanna hide some bitcoin with hints of how to get it, but I'm a bit broke.\n\n\nI would like to make a sort of Bitcoin scavenger hunt, with a prize at the end for whoever can figure out the private key.  This will be from various hints.  The only problem is that I don't have much btc right now.  If I were to do it now, the prize would barely be worth playing for, imho.  So, if you like this idea, tips would be appreciated.\n\n\n\"THIS IS DUMB HE JUST WANTS BTC AND HE'S NOT GONNA ACTUALLY DO IT!!1!!!\"\n\n\nI realize this is a valid concern.
