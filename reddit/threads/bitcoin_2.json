In DinoWorld, the currency is backed by Bitcoin and the blockchain (like when the dollar was backed by gold back in the day) so 100 DinoCredits would equal around 0.000100 Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DinoCredits could be a app on your phone, eg. a re-branded schildbach app. Instead of the app saying 1 BTC = $325, it could say 1 DinoCredit = 0.000001 Bitcoin. To make a purchase, the gamer would scan a qr code on the screen, click a bluetooth button or tap the phone on a nfc receiver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the rapid changes in Bitcoin prices, items in the games could be ran off a live exchange with other gamers. There would be a 25% fee on all trades that goes to the developers. When Bitcoin goes up in value, gamer 1 could trade axe to gamer 2 for 50 DinoCredits.\nIf the gamer decides he no longer wants the axe, they can sell it for 75 DinoCredits and the credits would be sent back to the DinoWallet. Gamer 1 can now use the 75 DinoCredits towards a axe deluxe gamer 3 is selling for 145 DinoCredits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because DinoCredits is backed by Bitcoin and the blockchain, gamers can use DinoCredits to purchase anything they could with Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When another game is released based around Bitcoins, gamers can now use 500 DinoCredits to purchase a neon light on a car in BitRacing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I can see happening, a developer releasing a wallet app with a drop down menu with all games accepting or backing Bitcoin as currency.\nYou could search for the games you own/downloaded if the list is too long to find your game then add them to your favorites list.\nYou can switch between your favorites eg.

This is the law of inflation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not until all coins are mined will this cease to be an issue; this should occur around the year 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent this idea from having a significant effect on the market:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1a) There would have to be continual influxes of exceptional capital.

Positively, bitcoin investment may prove to be a great hedge against inflation; better than a savings account, this seems reasonable to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) As each bitcoin loses value, due to various reasons, miners will be obligated to sell any and all coins to maintain profits, and/or cover production costs.\nThis is a cycle that will feed itself until enough mining operations are forced to turn off their machines. If the algorithmic difficulty becomes too insurmountable, said difficulty will stall and allow for mining tools to become more advanced, inexpensive, and decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent this idea from having a significant effect on the market:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2a) Simple, inexpensive means of promoting a decentralized network. The more nodes, the less money will be required to support the system. Needs to be sustainable even after all reward blocks are exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2b) Increased, overall adoption is needed to create a self–sustaining market. This will be known to have occurred when bitcoin is actually used like any other currency. The fact that BTC cannot currently be accepted for most transactions, if not all, demotes its financial status to that of a commodity. Miners need to be able to pay their business costs (mining equipment, employee salaries, utilities, rent, et cetera) with bitcoin. An insular BTC market is what all the big–name economies strive for, if they are smart and conscientious of the future. For example, it should be easy to bring wealth into the ecosystem but undesirable to convert wealth out; this will be accomplished through economic incentives but not fascist, regulatory schemes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Total or greater loss of demand might occur based on both rational and emotional reasons. Either the majority of adopters blind themselves, and others, to the brilliance of this technical innovation, only to suckle upon the vampiric teat of the fiat system once again, OR a better version of the blockchain technology out competes the BTC version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent this idea from having a significant effect on the market:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3a) Technology improvements to the BTC technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3b) Education and transparency on bitcoin information. Fear is a symptom of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Deflation in value could occur when more vendors integrate bitcoin payment gateways disproportionately, in excess, to the amount of new consumer adopters. More BTC will be converted to fiat than fiat into bitcoin. This has been discussed the most, in the community, from what I have had the opportunity to observe. An increase of services and business adoption is an important and positive step forward but it is creating sell–pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent this idea from having a significant effect on the market:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4a) Similar problem to what mining operations are facing. Companies like Overstock need a convenient and market refined way of paying their business expenses in bitcoin. For example, businesses need to be able to restock their wares using BTC. This entails that their suppliers are also able to accept BTC and pay their own expenses with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4b) Consumers need more incentives and applications that make using bitcoin, on a daily basis, reasonable and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) There is a lack of wide–spread market adoption perpetuated by the bitcoin community as well as a combination of both vendor and consumer ignorance, fear, laziness, stupidity; this helps create market volatility, which is something that perpetuates the exact issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent this idea from having a significant effect on the market:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5a) As adoption increases and BTC wealth is spread out among more hands, currency conversions will have significantly less impact. For example, the influence whales could exert will be far diminished; furthermore, a self–actualized bitcoin economy might dissuade any whales from rocking the boat. Fortunately, the inflation created from mining does help to reduce the size of whales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5b) The current form of the cryptocurrency scene is not user–friendly, for the average man. It is not fun, it is not easy to use or understand. It is simple to lose wealth for unacceptable reasons such as client–side application bugs. Excuses are made for every conceivable weakness in the tech; there is a major blame the victim mentality. It is not okay, at this point, for someone to be asked to trust and invest significant sums of wealth in a buggy, &amp;quot;experimental&amp;quot; technology where educational transparency is at a minimum.\nToo many people, with bitcoin community influence, seem to have made too much money by investing at the right time. As a result, early adopters have been awarded large sums of play money for pocket change; not everyone can afford to make mistakes with bitcoin due to negligence on the part of developers (or whoever). Many investors, especially new adopters, are going to have to pony up much more for much less, with money earned through significantly longer/harder investments of labor. It is unacceptable for there not to be more security in place to safeguard this wealth influx. It is inconsiderate and disrespectful for there not to be.\nUsing BTC should be an experience that is rewarding, fun, easy, simple and stress–free. One can claim that it is good enough but I say, &amp;quot;good is the enemy of great.&amp;quot;\nI have a background in customer service relations, information architecture and graphic design. The situation is far from optimized imo; the basics of user experience need work. It is common for technical people to be dismissive of this aspect of reality, as it is some sort of badge of intelligence, however, this would be a very short–sighted and foolish arrogance to embrace right now, if not always.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5c) Better education with examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Greed and market dilution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent this idea from having a significant effect on the market:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6a) There needs to be a change of focus away from getting rich quick off of cryptocurrency. Absolutely, people should be patient and ready to capitalize on opportunities but the focus should be on the evolution of the technology, which should make us all wealthier, in the long run. Let the greedy money come in but be aware that the other side of this coin is the quick, emotional, panic sells that lead to instability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6b) Alternative currencies are spreading the current market capital too thin. Most of the coins are horse shit and we all know it; some altcoins have merit. In fact, I would be totally unfazed if an altcoin was named horseshit coin; it is that bad.\nIt should be clear, by now, that no one is getting &amp;quot;bitcoin rich&amp;quot; off of any of these forked BTC protocols. Their value is too closely synced to the tides of bitcoin market values, and if new adopters are unwilling to put their wealth in the most battle–hardened cryptocurrency, why in the world would anyone think that a sudden wave of significant treasure would come to bolster a less secure, basically unknown, random public ledger? It is unlikely, therefore, stop diluting the economy and focus on coins with merit. At this point, it doesnt matter if altcoin A boasts faster transaction times, or altcoin B has more than 21 million units, or altcoin C will be useful in tipping a woman for posting her three–thousandth, heavily edited selfie in order to raise her self–esteem. It is clear by now that the core demographic of cryptocurrency adopters do not care and therefore, my guess is that the rest of the world will not either (at least not until they accept BTC first). Redundant and asinine altcoins, created without purpose, only serve to hurt the overall market, confuse new adopters, and present this industry as a joke to entities that greatly matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did I miss, or where am I completely wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us discuss and thanks for reading and considering my ruminations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR/recap&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Miners are causing inflation, which lowers value of individual coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: Not enough incoming capital to offset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Miners selling BTC, for fiat, to pay for mining expenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: Need to be able to pay for everything in BTC in a well–developed, self-sustaining BTC economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Emotional and rational reasons turning people, and their wealth, away from BTC, towards an altcoin or back towards fiat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: Bitcoin technology and education surrounding the tech could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Increase in vendors accepting BTC but converting into fiat.

Our hot wallet was compromised and our attackers managed to steal a little over 15 BTC of funds that were held in escrow.  The nature of the attack was such that it was not immediately clear that anything had happened, which is why it has taken us until today to take action.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the majority of users funds being held in escrow were safe in offline storage, so the impact of this attack was lessened.  Please be assured that any users that have payments or refunds due will be contacted over the next few days and your money will be paid.  The owners of CryptoThrift are absorbing the cost of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst we have not yet completed our investigation, we have identified the attack vector as a vulnerability in a third party plugin.  This was used to inject SQL queries into our database and manipulate the amounts on transactions being released from escrow.  What we have not made public until now is that we have seen sustained and almost-daily attack attempts on the site for many months.  We have been in contact with the Australian Federal Police regarding this, and will be sharing with them all data that we have on this attack as well as all previous attempts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This attack has prompted us to reflect on our security measures, and we have concluded that we need to make some significant changes to our escrow process, our storage of customers funds, and have a third-party conduct a full security audit.  Until this is complete, we feel we have no choice but temporarily suspend our escrow service for our users, as we simply cannot risk holding users funds.  Effective immediately, buyers will no longer be able to choose to use escrow when purchasing items.  All existing transactions that are in escrow will be honored until they are released or refunded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CryptoThrift is owned and operated by two guys, both with families and full-time jobs, who run this site in their evenings and weekends to try and create something new for the crypto community.  We have made every effort to provide good customer service and have put 100% of all profits back into development, advertising, and marketing.  A such, the cost of this theft is being covered by us personally.  If our attackers wish to do the right thing and return our funds to us, they can do so by sending it back to 19bBwiFrAaCLxZZoS4grTDoFFVszxzvPMo.  If any of our users wish to help, we would gratefully receive donations of support to the same address.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We must sincerely apologize to our loyal users for this breach and our decision to temporarily remove our escrow service.  It is heartbreaking for us to see our hard work destroyed by cold-hearted, thoughtless, hackers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your support, and we hope that you continue to use our site.
