I had a question about buying btc in a somewhat unorthodox way though. I am trying to have people deposit funds anonymously and then I can use those funds to purchase bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Previously the way I would do this would be to have the person buying the btc buy a greendot or amazon giftcard then send me the number then I would use bitcoin-otc to trade for btc. Also before bitinstant start requiring verification I would have them go to walmart and make deposits with moneygram. It seems I can still do this with localbitcoins but the service charge seems somewhat high on most of these options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a cheaper way than that I can have a third party add funds anonymously for me to buy btc?

          "selftext": "Hi all, I've been out of bitcoin for a little while but am wanting to get back into it. I had a question about buying btc in a somewhat unorthodox way though. I am trying to have people deposit funds anonymously and then I can use those funds to purchase bitcoin. \n\nPreviously the way I would do this would be to have the person buying the btc buy a greendot or amazon giftcard then send me the number then I would use bitcoin-otc to trade for btc. Also before bitinstant start requiring verification I would have them go to walmart and make deposits with moneygram. It seems I can still do this with localbitcoins but the service charge seems somewhat high on most of these options.\n\nIs there a cheaper way than that I can have a third party add funds anonymously for me to buy btc?
