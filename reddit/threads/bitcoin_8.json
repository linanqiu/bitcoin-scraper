          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came up with an idea for a Bitcoin feature, it would need changes to the existing software and I am sure it would not be a small task, I am also uncertain on the specifics of how it would work cryptographically but from my understanding of the technologies it would not require anything that we do not already know. I am interested to know if anything like this has been proposed before, I think it would have major advantages for the adoption of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was initially trying to think of how to solve the problem of needing to move coins when the private key wasn&amp;#39;t available, such as if someone lost them, or even if the owner died, although that in itself isn&amp;#39;t a widespread problem, I think that what I came up with has larger benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the solution is not going to allow arbitrary raids on other peoples Bitcoin addresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution is for the person who owns the wallet to generate additional secondary keys, either when the wallet is first created or at any time later. These secondary keys are distinct from the primary key that controls the wallet and can safely be given to people you might (or might not) trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like regular keys the secondary keys could be used to sign a transaction and move coins on behalf of the address. However, the transactions signed by these keys would be distinct, and nodes would recognize that the transaction has been signed by a secondary key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When such a transaction was relayed it would be written into the blockchain like normal, however, like newly mined coins, the output coins from the transaction would not be spendable for a significant number of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this stage a few things could have happened:-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The genuine owner of the wallet lost their private keys. They went to their trusted friend and told them about the loss, the friend helped them recover their funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The genuine owner of the wallet died. The coins were moved by a relative or solicitor who had been trusted with a secondary key. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Someone who had been trusted with the key went rogue and decided to steal the coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the new transaction is initially recorded in the blockchain it will be publicly visible. At this point, if the person who owns the wallet is still around then they should be able to get an alert, triggered by the visibility of the new transaction on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the owner did not want the transaction to go through, then they could sign a different transaction with their own primary key to move the coins to a new wallet, or write a command to the blockchain to cancel the original transaction and render the outputs from the transaction that was signed by the secondary key to &amp;#39;permanently immature&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;dead&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the owner of the wallet wanted the transaction to happen then they would just do nothing. Eventually the coins moved by the secondary keys would mature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the coins were moved by a primary key before they had matured from being moved by the secondary key, then the Bitcoin system would have to realize this and not allow the coins moved by the secondary key to mature, ever. Clearly this requires big changes to existing software and would increase &amp;#39;spam&amp;#39; on the blockchain as all failed transactions would be recorded permanently on the blockchain, it would be appropriate for someone using a secondary key to pay a miners fee from their own wallet that would mature regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would all allow a user to generate additional keys to give out to friends who might be able to help in case of difficulty or to family, solicitors, etc. And not have to worry that they could run off with all their coins. An additional feature could be added that would encode other information into the keys other than that they were primary or secondary. Perhaps the key is only allowed to send a certain volume of transactions or the time it takes for the outputs to mature varies by key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this was developed then it could also fix a criticism about Bitcoin that I quite frequently see, that it does not have a feature like direct debits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For many of us, the fact that another organisation cannot simply dip into our wallets and take our money is a huge bonus that Bitcoin offers over traditional banking systems. It can not be denied however that this does lead to an increased inconvenience when trying to use Bitcoin for every day life and a reluctance of organisations like utility companies to accept Bitcoin. A secondary key as described could be issued for a wallet and be given to another entity such as an energy or water supplier, as long as the owner of the wallet was reasonably pro-active in watching out for payment alerts, then there is no risk of the utility company running away with the funds.

          "selftext": "I came up with an idea for a Bitcoin feature, it would need changes to the existing software and I am sure it would not be a small task, I am also uncertain on the specifics of how it would work cryptographically but from my understanding of the technologies it would not require anything that we do not already know. I am interested to know if anything like this has been proposed before, I think it would have major advantages for the adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nI was initially trying to think of how to solve the problem of needing to move coins when the private key wasn't available, such as if someone lost them, or even if the owner died, although that in itself isn't a widespread problem, I think that what I came up with has larger benefits.\n\nFirstly, the solution is not going to allow arbitrary raids on other peoples Bitcoin addresses.\n\nThe solution is for the person who owns the wallet to generate additional secondary keys, either when the wallet is first created or at any time later. These secondary keys are distinct from the primary key that controls the wallet and can safely be given to people you might (or might not) trust.\n\nLike regular keys the secondary keys could be used to sign a transaction and move coins on behalf of the address. However, the transactions signed by these keys would be distinct, and nodes would recognize that the transaction has been signed by a secondary key.\n\nWhen such a transaction was relayed it would be written into the blockchain like normal, however, like newly mined coins, the output coins from the transaction would not be spendable for a significant number of blocks.\n\nAt this stage a few things could have happened:-\n\n1) The genuine owner of the wallet lost their private keys. They went to their trusted friend and told them about the loss, the friend helped them recover their funds.\n\n2) The genuine owner of the wallet died. The coins were moved by a relative or solicitor who had been trusted with a secondary key. \n\n3) Someone who had been trusted with the key went rogue and decided to steal the coins.\n\nWhen the new transaction is initially recorded in the blockchain it will be publicly visible. At this point, if the person who owns the wallet is still around then they should be able to get an alert, triggered by the visibility of the new transaction on the blockchain.\n\nIf the owner did not want the transaction to go through, then they could sign a different transaction with their own primary key to move the coins to a new wallet, or write a command to the blockchain to cancel the original transaction and render the outputs from the transaction that was signed by the secondary key to 'permanently immature' or 'dead'.\n\nIf the owner of the wallet wanted the transaction to happen then they would just do nothing. Eventually the coins moved by the secondary keys would mature.\n\nIf the coins were moved by a primary key before they had matured from being moved by the secondary key, then the Bitcoin system would have to realize this and not allow the coins moved by the secondary key to mature, ever. Clearly this requires big changes to existing software and would increase 'spam' on the blockchain as all failed transactions would be recorded permanently on the blockchain, it would be appropriate for someone using a secondary key to pay a miners fee from their own wallet that would mature regardless.\n\nThis would all allow a user to generate additional keys to give out to friends who might be able to help in case of difficulty or to family, solicitors, etc. And not have to worry that they could run off with all their coins. An additional feature could be added that would encode other information into the keys other than that they were primary or secondary. Perhaps the key is only allowed to send a certain volume of transactions or the time it takes for the outputs to mature varies by key.\n\nIf this was developed then it could also fix a criticism about Bitcoin that I quite frequently see, that it does not have a feature like direct debits.\n\nFor many of us, the fact that another organisation cannot simply dip into our wallets and take our money is a huge bonus that Bitcoin offers over traditional banking systems. It can not be denied however that this does lead to an increased inconvenience when trying to use Bitcoin for every day life and a reluctance of organisations like utility companies to accept Bitcoin. A secondary key as described could be issued for a wallet and be given to another entity such as an energy or water supplier, as long as the owner of the wallet was reasonably pro-active in watching out for payment alerts, then there is no risk of the utility company running away with the funds. I am thinking that a typical 'maturing time' specified for a secondary key that was given to the water company would be something like 14 31 days, if Bitcoin were to be used as a daily fact of life then we might assume that people would have ample opportunity to spot the cancellable payments.\n\nAs an alternative to somehow being encoded in the key, the info about the limits of the new key could be written into the blockchain at the time the key is created, probably a miners fee would have to be paid. When the key was used nodes would check that it was acting within its limits in terms of potentially many variables: Date ranges the key is valid for, transaction limits, frequency limits and receiver address.\n\nI think it would be a big advantage to Bitcoin if it allowed for direct-debit like features and I could see a lot more organisations and major companies accepting it as a valid payment method.

Once Bob set his insurance reserve, he can forget about it.\nUnconfirmed transactions in Bitcoin arrive to your merchant approximately in 20 seconds, while waiting for Bitcoin Network confirmation usually takes from ~~10 to ~~40 minutes Next time he goes shopping for products with immediate shipping, he just easily pays his 1 BTC to anyone who support immediate payments feature. And once he&amp;#39;s done his payment merchant gets his unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction, next step for merchant is getting that callback URL from insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case if Bob making a double-spending, the system recognizes that &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;reserves his 1 BTC&lt;/strong&gt; to cover double-spend expense When Bob will make a payment from his wallet, his wallet notifies &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; about his original sender to reserve that 1 BTC. Once that 1 BTC is reserved, &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; will send only 1 callback to 1 chosen company. If Bob will send different transactions with the same Bitcoins to the other companies, these companies will receive unconfirmed transactions in their address without knowing that it is a double-spending, but this companies won&amp;#39;t authorize transaction, because these companies won&amp;#39;t receive callback from the service\nIf no one offered this before I will be highly surprised.

I am not the antichrist, of the one in a King&amp;#39;s James Bible. I am a sovereign human asking for permission from my consciousness, the one i have chosen to label &amp;quot;government&amp;quot;. The grievances are enormous. Collectively as a history, in the last hundred years, have been absolutely horrible to potentially die of non-natural causes. The intensity is starting to ramp up, and to be honest I&amp;#39;m quite sick of it. I think that humans all around the world should unite, praise our virtues, and live in peace. If you someone in the military, and you justify killing other humans for a fictitious profit in your bank account, we collectively want you to know that what we think you do is wrong, and should consider stop doing it. You should live with the rest of us humans who just want to live, and not be pestered by the prospect of spending any amount of it warehoused in close proximity to others being warehoused. this is a disgrace to of had come to the conclusion, that because one is wicked in heart, we should inflict more wickedness upon us. Is this what Jesus of Nazareth taught? No, he taught to turn the other cheek. As an American, I think I justly deserve the opportunity to speak freely to the world at this time. As a citizen, I am not pleased with what my government has done. We commit atrocities all across the world, in the name of some economic function that was designed to separate and create another layer of illusion between us. The emerging generation that is coming through is a lot more conscientious and truly capable of saving the world from anywhere you are. And if there&amp;#39;s only one thing, you should ever try and do, it&amp;#39;d be to, and this by the way is not exclusive to to any &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;, the poor and the rich can participate, and that is to make someone else happy, everyday. your life will change. you lighten up. you&amp;#39;ll shine really brightly. everyone will see you. you will be thriving. you will see everyone. just like you. thriving. If you&amp;#39;re a citizen of another country that isn&amp;#39;t the &amp;quot;United States of America&amp;quot;, I want you to know that we love you. We really, really, really do. We don&amp;#39;t believe the official story of what really happened on 09/11/01. If something really crazy disastrous event were to happen, and it was later found out that we were the perpetrators in a chase for Earth&amp;#39;s Natural Resources, I want you to know that as a citizen, it deeply saddens me that people have to die. We don&amp;#39;t have that much hatred in our hearts to commit these acts. Our elections are bought and paid for by the &amp;quot;rich and powerful&amp;quot;, and we lost the integrity of our government all together. We want to start a revolution. We&amp;#39;ll start in our hearts. I am only one person. I have personally been responsible for things that I am deeply ashamed of, and if you knew what they were you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t like me at all. I am taking enormous &amp;quot;social risk&amp;quot; by even posting this. &amp;quot;But then again that&amp;#39;s just my brain talkin&amp;quot;, but this is serious. If someone could help me translate this message in every language, and document, that at one point in history, we humans really had to fight imaginations of separateness. When you harm another, you harm yourself. We&amp;#39;re trying very hard over here to change things, but we&amp;#39;re too occupied with our jobs, to give us a sense of worth. Do I believe in Bitcoin? Yes. It&amp;#39;s an alternate to the current paradigm. Think of how many happy people, will spend their money, if you knew it&amp;#39;d make them rich. We could end world hunger. We could be better and better everyday. It&amp;#39;s okay to make mistakes. Learn that&amp;#39;s what they are, and continue to love yourself.
