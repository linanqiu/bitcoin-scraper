What has been catching my attention, though, are the 'righteous revolutionaries' who have broken. One guy who proselytized about 'world change' and how 'price doesn't matter' broke...because the price fell too low.\n\nAnother now in BitcoinMarkets who post endless charts and predictions broke too. Again, the price.\n\nAnd these are just the ones I noticed and/or revealed it. How many other revolutionaries and fortune tellers have broken? How many of these people talking about buying are telling the truth vs being con artists? I would like to see a signed BTC address as proof from now on. I doubt I will.\n\nTo get to the point, it sure is easy to wax poetry when the times are good or even mild, but it sure is difficult when the going gets tough, eh?\n\nI wonder how many more Benedict Arnolds, false prophets, and general weak hands we'll see by the end of this bloodbath.",

As one commenter pointed out, the average lifetime salary for a person is about $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are still people out there with *over 100,000 bitcoin.

          "selftext": "Many have been waiting for the next big price push, maybe a multi-thousand dollar price is just around the corner?\n\nBut there's a problem with that thought. \n\nThe problem is that bitcoin is very new, and individuals still hold very large amounts of bitcoin.\n\nAnd the higher the price goes, the larger the temptation for them to *sell* and reap the rewards of their foresight. \n\nI remember reading not long ago about a guy with 2,000 bitcoin that sold them all at the $1,000 price last December and said he was going backpacking for 9 months. \n\nAnd good for him! As one commenter pointed out, the average lifetime salary for a person is about $2 million.\n\nThere are still people out there with *over 100,000 bitcoin. Maybe some of them are strong hands, maybe they're waiting for the next $1,000 price, or maybe they're scared right now and getting out. Dunno.\n\nBut after them are all the people that own 10,000 bitcoin.
