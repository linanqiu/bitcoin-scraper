I am not the antichrist, of the one in a King&amp;#39;s James Bible. I am a sovereign human asking for permission from my consciousness, the one i have chosen to label &amp;quot;government&amp;quot;. The grievances are enormous. Collectively as a history, in the last hundred years, have been absolutely horrible to potentially die of non-natural causes. The intensity is starting to ramp up, and to be honest I&amp;#39;m quite sick of it. I think that humans all around the world should unite, praise our virtues, and live in peace. If you someone in the military, and you justify killing other humans for a fictitious profit in your bank account, we collectively want you to know that what we think you do is wrong, and should consider stop doing it. You should live with the rest of us humans who just want to live, and not be pestered by the prospect of spending any amount of it warehoused in close proximity to others being warehoused. this is a disgrace to of had come to the conclusion, that because one is wicked in heart, we should inflict more wickedness upon us. Is this what Jesus of Nazareth taught? No, he taught to turn the other cheek. As an American, I think I justly deserve the opportunity to speak freely to the world at this time. As a citizen, I am not pleased with what my government has done. We commit atrocities all across the world, in the name of some economic function that was designed to separate and create another layer of illusion between us. The emerging generation that is coming through is a lot more conscientious and truly capable of saving the world from anywhere you are. And if there&amp;#39;s only one thing, you should ever try and do, it&amp;#39;d be to, and this by the way is not exclusive to to any &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;, the poor and the rich can participate, and that is to make someone else happy, everyday. your life will change. you lighten up. you&amp;#39;ll shine really brightly. everyone will see you. you will be thriving. you will see everyone. just like you. thriving. If you&amp;#39;re a citizen of another country that isn&amp;#39;t the &amp;quot;United States of America&amp;quot;, I want you to know that we love you. We really, really, really do. We don&amp;#39;t believe the official story of what really happened on 09/11/01. If something really crazy disastrous event were to happen, and it was later found out that we were the perpetrators in a chase for Earth&amp;#39;s Natural Resources, I want you to know that as a citizen, it deeply saddens me that people have to die. We don&amp;#39;t have that much hatred in our hearts to commit these acts. Our elections are bought and paid for by the &amp;quot;rich and powerful&amp;quot;, and we lost the integrity of our government all together. We want to start a revolution.

          "selftext": "do not be afraid. whatever you do, always remember to keep your peace. the world may be falling apart all around you, and you think that life won't continue on if you do not complete these self imposed tasks. i promise you the natural course of things will continue. there is more than enough to go around and feed not only the world, and all of her inhabitants. think about the blessing we've been gifted. that of remembering things. let's remember what it's like to of not had to in the first place. only a peace in ones heart among all of earths inhabitants at once. what a gloryful sight. sadly the bitter reality is that life continues on once you're gone. for all you know, this is your life, and it counts. governments can't complain if everyone gets into prayer all at once, and all around there's peace. all nations should keep it in their moral interest to not want to kill citizens of a planet we all live on. i call for the disarmament of all nations. I am not the antichrist, of the one in a King's James Bible. I am a sovereign human asking for permission from my consciousness, the one i have chosen to label \"government\". The grievances are enormous. Collectively as a history, in the last hundred years, have been absolutely horrible to potentially die of non-natural causes. The intensity is starting to ramp up, and to be honest I'm quite sick of it. I think that humans all around the world should unite, praise our virtues, and live in peace. If you someone in the military, and you justify killing other humans for a fictitious profit in your bank account, we collectively want you to know that what we think you do is wrong, and should consider stop doing it. You should live with the rest of us humans who just want to live, and not be pestered by the prospect of spending any amount of it warehoused in close proximity to others being warehoused. this is a disgrace to of had come to the conclusion, that because one is wicked in heart, we should inflict more wickedness upon us. Is this what Jesus of Nazareth taught? No, he taught to turn the other cheek. As an American, I think I justly deserve the opportunity to speak freely to the world at this time. As a citizen, I am not pleased with what my government has done. We commit atrocities all across the world, in the name of some economic function that was designed to separate and create another layer of illusion between us. The emerging generation that is coming through is a lot more conscientious and truly capable of saving the world from anywhere you are. And if there's only one thing, you should ever try and do, it'd be to, and this by the way is not exclusive to to any \"class\", the poor and the rich can participate, and that is to make someone else happy, everyday. your life will change. you lighten up. you'll shine really brightly. everyone will see you. you will be thriving. you will see everyone. just like you. thriving. If you're a citizen of another country that isn't the \"United States of America\", I want you to know that we love you. We really, really, really do. We don't believe the official story of what really happened on 09/11/01. If something really crazy disastrous event were to happen, and it was later found out that we were the perpetrators in a chase for Earth's Natural Resources, I want you to know that as a citizen, it deeply saddens me that people have to die. We don't have that much hatred in our hearts to commit these acts. Our elections are bought and paid for by the \"rich and powerful\", and we lost the integrity of our government all together. We want to start a revolution. We'll start in our hearts. I am only one person. I have personally been responsible for things that I am deeply ashamed of, and if you knew what they were you probably wouldn't like me at all. I am taking enormous \"social risk\" by even posting this. \"But then again that's just my brain talkin\", but this is serious.

He has 1 BTC in insurance reserve. Bob can withdraw his BTC only in a specified time window. Once Bob set his insurance reserve, he can forget about it.\nUnconfirmed transactions in Bitcoin arrive to your merchant approximately in 20 seconds, while waiting for Bitcoin Network confirmation usually takes from ~~10 to ~~40 minutes Next time he goes shopping for products with immediate shipping, he just easily pays his 1 BTC to anyone who support immediate payments feature. And once he&amp;#39;s done his payment merchant gets his unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction, next step for merchant is getting that callback URL from insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case if Bob making a double-spending, the system recognizes that &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;reserves his 1 BTC&lt;/strong&gt; to cover double-spend expense When Bob will make a payment from his wallet, his wallet notifies &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; about his original sender to reserve that 1 BTC. Once that 1 BTC is reserved, &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; will send only 1 callback to 1 chosen company. If Bob will send different transactions with the same Bitcoins to the other companies, these companies will receive unconfirmed transactions in their address without knowing that it is a double-spending, but this companies won&amp;#39;t authorize transaction, because these companies won&amp;#39;t receive callback from the service\nIf no one offered this before I will be highly surprised.

From a tax perspective, this means that a lot of people out there will be able to generate capital losses for the 2014 tax year (long-term capital losses, even) if they sell their BTC.\n\nWhat's so great about capital losses?\n\nWell suppose I bought 5 BTC in December 2013 for $1000 each. If the price of BTC is $375 in December 2014 then I can sell those 5 BTC to generate a long-term capital loss of $3125.\n\nLet's say that I make $40k per year so that my marginal income tax bracket is 25%. I can deduct up to $3000 in capital losses from my income taxes for 2014. This will cause the IRS to send me $750 extra on my tax refund. Any losses in excess of $3000 can be carried over to the next year, so no incentive to limit my selling to generating only those losses either.\n\nBut if I want my refund for the year 2014, I'd have to sell my coins before December 31st. A lot of people will: it's practically free money.\n\n**tl;dr** tax savings from generating capital losses will cause a selloff of coins around Christmas. Your merriness may vary.",

We will have more influencial people who grew up with Bitcoin and will demand it while we will have a very reduced supply compared with today. ",
