Our 200+ beta testers have given us great feedback and today, our biggest and most significant wallet update has finally been released for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Direct download: &lt;a href=\"https://mycelium.com/bitcoinwallet\"&gt;https://mycelium.com/bitcoinwallet&lt;/a&gt;\nOn Google Play we use staged rollout, where it is released gradually over the next few days: &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet\"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New Features:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added support for BIP32/BIP44 compliant HD accounts based on a single master seed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A much simpler backup that uses a word list to backup all your HD accounts (BIP39)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No more address reuse, which greatly increases privacy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can label transactions in transaction history&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transactions can be created with poor or no internet connectivity, and be broadcast later&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can now have unlimited number of watch-only addresses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cold Storage spending now let&amp;#39;s you spend unconfirmed inputs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does HD mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HD is short for Hierarchical Deterministic. Typically, bitcoin wallets generate each new bitcoin address from a unique random number, requiring a separate backup of each new address. To avoid losses from lack of backups, such wallets use a single bitcoin address for all your transactions. HD wallets instead use a “master seed” (a single large random number), to derive all future bitcoin addresses sequentially from that single seed. This means that you only need to make a backup once, and all the keys generated by an HD wallet can be restored at any time in the future just from that single master seed. HD wallets greatly improve your privacy by being able to keep generating new addresses. If you use the same address continuously all your transactions will be associated with a single address, and because all bitcoin transactions are public anyone can see what addresses you are sending funds to, and calculate your total balance. With an HD account new addresses are created whenever you send and receive funds, making your transaction activity and total balance very hard to track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I liked it the way it was! Will I have to change the way I use it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All your keys, addresses and address book entries will be retained when you upgrade your app. The tab previously named “Keys” has been renamed to “Accounts.” Your old bitcoin addresses will become single address accounts, and you can continue to use them as before. We do advise that you switch to new HD accounts, though. You will also see your first empty HD account, which you can start using right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about previous backups? Do my old ones still work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. You can still import keys and addresses you backed up with the previous version of Mycelium Wallet. However, we have removed the ability to create backups of single keys, or create new single addresses accounts. Instead, we advise you to backup your master seed and move your funds to the new HD wallet. As long as you keep your old backups, though, you will be able to recover your legacy accounts using Mycelium. To import a private key, switch to the “Accounts” tab, tap the icon with a key and plus symbol in the upper right corner, and select “Advanced”. Then scan your encrypted private key and enter the password.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I be able to continue to use my current Local Trader identity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. Your Local Trader identity will get carried over to the new version when upgrading along with your private keys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I make a backup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To create a backup, either tap the “Secure My Funds” button on the main page, or choose “backup” from the menu. You will be shown a list of words, one after the other. Write those words down with pen &amp;amp; paper. You then have to type in the words again, to make sure you got everything right. Store this word list in a safe place! Anybody who obtains this list can access current and future funds in your wallet! \nNote: The backup procedure only backs up your HD accounts. Your classic single address accounts are not part of this backup procedure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I restore a backup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your phone is lost or damaged you can make a fresh install of the mycelium wallet on a different device. Upon startup, choose “Restore Backup”. Choose 12 as the length of your word list, and let the “password” checkbox unchecked, and proceed to enter your word list. This recreates your master seed and automatically creates and synchronizes your first HD account. It might take some time until your first account is synchronized and the balance updates. If you had more than one account, navigate to the “Accounts” tab, tap the button with a key icon and plus on the upper right corner, and choose “Add HD Account” to re-create your second account, etc. Note: This procedure only restores your HD accounts. To restore your classic accounts you have to manually import each key/address by going to the Accounts tab, click the + button, select Advanced, and then Import. If your previous Mycelium installation had a Local Trader account you can recreate your trader account and data by clicking “Buy/Sell Bitcoins”, select the “My Info” tab, click “Create” and select the account that your local trader identity was associated with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I restore a BIP44 wallet created with other software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. When you start a fresh install of the app you get the option to restore a backup. You can choose between word lists lengths of 12, 18, or 24 words, and also supply an optional password in accordance with BIP44. This way you can restore all HD accounts generated by other wallets compatible with BIP44 and BIP39. For instance, this allows you to import your TREZOR word list in case your device was lost or damaged so you can quickly move your funds to safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was invited to speak at the Coins in the Kingdom conference back in August, and the terms were that I would have my hotel room paid for but I had to pay for travel. Several of the people speaking were friends of mine who I hadn&amp;#39;t seen in a while, so I gladly accepted, and bought my plane ticket that night. Less than a week before the conference, speakers were emailed with bad news - some sponsors had backed out of their obligations last minute and so accommodations would be tight. They made a request: &amp;quot;Would it be possible for you to cover the cost of your hotel stay?&amp;quot; Being the scrappy young entrepreneur that I am, four nights at a hotel in downtown Disney was just not in the budget. I emailed back saying that I could not cover that cost on such short notice, but that I would be willing to share a room with someone if it came to that. I didn&amp;#39;t hear back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the hotel, Jason (who was a co-organizer of the conference) was in the lobby, and I explained to him my predicament.

          "selftext": "I was invited to speak at the Coins in the Kingdom conference back in August, and the terms were that I would have my hotel room paid for but I had to pay for travel. Several of the people speaking were friends of mine who I hadn't seen in a while, so I gladly accepted, and bought my plane ticket that night. Less than a week before the conference, speakers were emailed with bad news - some sponsors had backed out of their obligations last minute and so accommodations would be tight. They made a request: \"Would it be possible for you to cover the cost of your hotel stay?\" Being the scrappy young entrepreneur that I am, four nights at a hotel in downtown Disney was just not in the budget. I emailed back saying that I could not cover that cost on such short notice, but that I would be willing to share a room with someone if it came to that. I didn't hear back. \n\nWhen I arrived at the hotel, Jason (who was a co-organizer of the conference) was in the lobby, and I explained to him my predicament. Without a moment's hesitation, he offered to cover the room for me with his own credit card. It was the first time we'd \"officially\" met in person, and I was floored. I wanted to hug the guy, it was such a genuine moment of empathy and kindness unlike anything I've experienced in recent memory, but instead I just stood there, shocked, and could only say \"thanks alot.\" \n\nI want to say \"thank you\" again here in /r/bitcoin because it's the least I can do for someone who has done me a big favor in the face of incredible adversity. The conference was organized with accessibility in mind: tickets were only $60, kids 12 and under got in free, and there was a room set up just for kids to play in while the adults listened to the wonderful speakers that were invited. With such a low ticket price, I'm sure a lot of the cost was subsidized by sponsors. The ones that dropped out nearly killed the event, putting everything on thin ice, but Jason and his co-organizers pulled it off anyway and held a conference which was [truly one for the history books](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/518772648143499264). To top it all off, we had a great day of fun and magic at Disney World the day after the conference. \n\nJason, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your kindness and congratulations on pulling off such a great conference. This story will confirm for many what those who have been in this community for a while already know: you are an amazing individual.
