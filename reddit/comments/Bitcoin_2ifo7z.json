In a sense every node in the network holds your Bitcoin. \n\nWhat owner ship of Bitcoin gets defined as is holding the private keys. So while everyone has your Bitcoin only the person with a key to unlock it can spend it. We therefore consider the person to have the key to be the owner of the Bitcoin. \n\nA wallet holds these private keys, in the case of Circle they hold the private keys. Since he who owns the private key owns the Bitcoin this means Circle owns the Bitcoin on your behalf. Using a wallet of your own makes you independent as you hold it your self. \n\nSo when holding Bitcoin yourself you must be careful. You must have a back up of these keys incase one gets lost. You don't so much need to  be consciously aware of these keys as wallet software handles it all in the background. However to grasp the concept of a paper wallet and it's usefulness you should. These private keys must be kept private so you want to have a strong password that encrypts them and you don't share them with people.\n\nSo what is a paper wallet. It's a peace of paper that has the private key to your Bitcoin address written on it. So this is useful because of malware. If your computer is infected with viruses they might try and steel your private keys. So you put them on paper. Due to the way Bitcoin works you don't need the internet to generate private keys. So what users do is use a computer that doesn't have internet access, never has, and never will. You generate the keys on this computer and then print it out as a paper wallet. This is what you call cold storage. It means that your Bitcoin have never once ben exposed to any component that a hacker could try and attack. Essentially a paper wallet (is made properly) makes it impossible for anyone to steel your Bitcoin remotely as they need physical access to the paper. \n\n\n&gt;Which wallet is good for a new bitcoin user?\n\n\nMy self I would recommend Electrum as it is a deterministic wallet. For example with Bitcoin QT it generates an address and each address afterwards that it generates is entirely new. So if you lost your wallet and went to an old back up all the new Bitcoins aren't in that back up. With a deterministic wallet like Electrum all Bitcoin  address from the past and from the future are stored in the backup. So you don't need to make constant backups for new addresses as it remains safe. \n\nBitgo is also a good option for new users security wise as it is multi sig (apparently its the wallet Ashton Kutcher uses). The way BitGo works is they hold 1 key, you hold 2 keys of which 1 key is your main one (that you use for regular spending) the other key is your back up key. Now BitGo is a 2 of 3 multisig. So this means you need 2 of the 3 keys to spend Bitcoin. So what happens is you use one to sign a transaction and BitGo uses the other. Since both keys are needed is your computer is compromised BitGo has limits on your spending that protects you from a hacker as the hacker can't use your key to spend Bitcoin. This also means that (unlike Circle) BitGo doesn't control your Bitcoin because they need you to move it. The backup key is something you keep ultra safe which is used incase BitGo disapears and they can't sign a transaction. By using your main key and your back up key together this means 2 of 3 keys are available and the Bitcoin is still yours. ",

I recommend setting up a 2nd bank account for &amp;quot;less trust&amp;quot; purposes. Example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main checking account = direct deposit paycheck from work + high trust groups (utilities, rent/mortgage, and credit cards)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2nd checking account = less trust groups (bitcoin, PayPal, anything that doesn&amp;#39;t happen every month)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way, if something goes foul, the larger amount of funds in your main account are not affected and any account freezes don&amp;#39;t stop you from buying food and shelter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This would provide clear separation of donations from other bitcoin that you own (there is no practical limit to the number of subtrees and sub-subtrees).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With BIP32, a subtree may have a &amp;#39;master public key&amp;#39;. This could be safely coded inside a website to generate donation addresses dynamically.  The private key for that subtree, or the &amp;#39;master private key&amp;#39; could be used to move funds from those accounts, so it needs to be kept secret and not encoded on the website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps. I realize that this can be confusing.  Ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But it could do this in multiple requests.\n\nFrom a [Stack Overflow](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/11054/understanding-spv-simple-payment-verification) answer:\n\n&gt; Practical implementations of SPV nodes today however use a protocol extension called bloom filters, described in BIP 37. They use getheaders to fetch block information prior to their wallet's birth timestamp, and request filtered blocks afterwards. To do so, they submit a bloom filter that describes the addresses and transactions they are interested in to the peer. The peer then only includes the relevant transactions in blocks it submits, together with their Merkle paths to prove that these transactions were indeed part of said block.\n\nSo, to answer your question more directly, your Client using Bloom Filters could request its relevant transactions in multiple requests, which might link `1BashCo` address to a bunch of addresses (one of which is yours), and another `1BashCo` address to a different set of addresses (one of which is yours).  And the only person who could potentially \"see\" that linkage is the particular SPV peer or a man in the middle.  (and you could ask different things from different peers).\n\nSo it's not all that trivial.  Pretty good protection actually.  \n\nOf course, normal Blockchain taint analysis might link more of your addresses together.",

They use getheaders to fetch block information prior to their wallet&amp;#39;s birth timestamp, and request filtered blocks afterwards. To do so, they submit a bloom filter that describes the addresses and transactions they are interested in to the peer. The peer then only includes the relevant transactions in blocks it submits, together with their Merkle paths to prove that these transactions were indeed part of said block.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question more directly, your Client using Bloom Filters could request its relevant transactions in multiple requests, which might link &lt;code&gt;1BashCo&lt;/code&gt; address to a bunch of addresses (one of which is yours), and another &lt;code&gt;1BashCo&lt;/code&gt; address to a different set of addresses (one of which is yours).  And the only person who could potentially &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; that linkage is the particular SPV peer or a man in the middle.  (and you could ask different things from different peers).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not all that trivial.  Pretty good protection actually.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, normal Blockchain taint analysis might link more of your addresses together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
