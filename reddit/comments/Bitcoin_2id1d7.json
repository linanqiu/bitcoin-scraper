See, like having to post this to counteract something that&amp;#39;s just not true- that&amp;#39;s not fun. Reading reddit&amp;#39;s not fun, because it&amp;#39;s just made up shit about me and people I know personally. My whole approach to &amp;quot;celebrity journalism&amp;quot; has changed now that I&amp;#39;m friends with some of these people. It just sucks. Saying things about someone you know aren&amp;#39;t true, or that you have no basis for saying, it&amp;#39;s just not very evolved stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peace&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
