For more details about this, read the full report here:\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/bitcoinarmory-media/CVEs/ArmoryCVE-2014-002.pdf\n\nArmory Tech has pretty thoroughly investigated the incident and believes that no action is needed by anyone, even if you have signed thousands of messages.  Armory Technologies itself would be the most vulnerable since we use that feature to sign all of our releases.  We have determined that no exposure has occurred and still consider our offline signing key 100% safe.  Nonetheless, we have fixed the issue in this release.\n\n[b]Before asking lots of questions[/b] please read the above PDF which I spent an exceptional amount of time writing.  It is extremely thorough, both in terms of our own analysis and concerns raised by Sergio Del Lerner, whom we contacted to provide an independent third-party opinion.
