So many more people know what bitcoin is now, and they know it has *some* value, so the seed has been sewn.\n\nOn a different note, I don't think recurring progressively large bubbles are good for bitcoin in the long run. If we had another perfectly timed and proportionate bubble, anyone who bought some during, would know that it would be highly likely to lose value if they held onto it. So in the end, i'm patiently watching bitcoin do the right thing, which is whatever bitcoin does, because at an integral level bitcoin is and always will be an amazing tool.\n\nTo me, bitcoin has always had the same value: it's priceless.

I&amp;#39;m anxiously waiting for my skeptical friends and family to finally understand the benefit of P2P digital currencies. I&amp;#39;m waiting for them to realize that bitcoin is not some fad, scam, or get rich quick plan. So many more people know what bitcoin is now, and they know it has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; value, so the seed has been sewn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a different note, I don&amp;#39;t think recurring progressively large bubbles are good for bitcoin in the long run. If we had another perfectly timed and proportionate bubble, anyone who bought some during, would know that it would be highly likely to lose value if they held onto it. So in the end, i&amp;#39;m patiently watching bitcoin do the right thing, which is whatever bitcoin does, because at an integral level bitcoin is and always will be an amazing tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, bitcoin has always had the same value: it&amp;#39;s priceless. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It will be incrementally and not $10,000. Even with all 21 million mined assuming that 10-12% of them are lost for good due to lost passwords etc. and considering the average increase in energy costs annually if it keeps up at its current 10 year trend. the MAX 1 bitcoin could EVER be worth is $2,180-$2,445. That is not a random number, it is the byproduct of 5 classes of 50-70 students each (ivy league economics majors) running the numbers in a blind study (did not know anything more than the numbers, no idea it was tied to bitcoin) Over 90% of them reached the same conclusion. \n\nLastly, \"adoption\" as everyone wants to call it, has NOTHING to do with the price or value right now as less than 0.5% of companies that accept bitcoin have adopted it. \n\n99.5% of companies like overstock, newegg, tiger direct, dell, etc. use bitcoin as a marketing tool. None of the big players are holding any bitcoin, not even their profits from bitcoin sales. They have not adopted it, they are simply using a third party to make it easier for you to part with your money. 99.5% of companies never see a single bitcoin, and admittedly will tell you they have no interest in obtaining any bitcoin. \n\nTo make it clear, I AM an economics expert, a professor of economics @ one of the top 10 institutions in the world. I MYSELF DO HAVE BITCOIN, not as an investment, not because i have any disillusion of it making me rich although a good marketing ploy could spike the price again (highly unlikely as the major players have already done it and made more than they can spend in a lifetime) but, i own it because it is easy to use and makes sending money to family across the US, and friends overseas easier than tying my shoes. \n\nBitcoin has changed the way money is transferred for a small percentage of the world, it has laid the framework for a new kind of money to replace the worlds current financial infrastructure, but it is not the total package or the full solution. While all of you run around chasing the \"i'm going to get rich\" train. One of you, or maybe a small group of you are already seeing bitcoin for what it really is, what it really lacks, and know its real limits, and are using that knowledge to already start building the first real \"crypto currency\" as right now Bitcoin and every other coin out there are nothing more than cryptography based digital commodities, Not money, not currency, maybe ground breaking and on the fore front of technology, but not ever going to replace or even come close to having a market share with money.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin is not currency, nor is any other crypto at current. Bitcoin is your debit card you get from your bank, without your bank. Like that small 3.75 inch piece of plastic, it holds some money for you for when you want to spend it. When you swipe that plastic card at a retail location, it transferes 1's and 0's to another parties institution meaning they now own the money. Bitcoin has actually complicated that process as it ads a 3rd step. you scan a QR code, transfer the value and now the retailer has to have a party convert that bitcoin to cash or fiat so they can actually do something with it.\n\nLets not all be a flock of sheeple controlled my mass marketing and advertising that get led into believing that any current crypto currency is anything more than what it really is. Spend a few minutes and burn a little energy letting a few neurons fire and have a thought of your own not influenced by all the marketing and advertising that has been pumped in there when it comes to what current cryptos really are. You will quickly realize that all i have done is put the obvious into text, those who argue are not capable of their own thought process and are the future cast of \"Idiocracy the reality show\" much like the movie.\n\n",

The real, sustainable, adopted currency i can assure you has not been created yet. There are a TON of cryptos that have a ton of great features. Some outright blow my mind, but none fully fill the bill yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and argue now, I am well aware the truth hurts for most of you who bought in so insanely high without doing homework, and the only defense you have against the pain is spitting out random blather like you are a crypto genius who knows all. But the guys with brains are well aware that what we are seeing right now in the market is the new standard for bitcoin and its volatility, $275 -$400 Is bitcoins value, the humps were just well done marketing jobs and everyone rushing in because they didnt want to miss out on that magic $10,000 a coin day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sheeple are funny that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
