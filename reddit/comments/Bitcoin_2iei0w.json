Obviously, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose, but if anything the stat-sheet for bitcoin has gotten massively more impressive in the last year. I bought a good amount last year and I just bought a lot more today despite being quite in the hole from my purchases last year.

All bets are off if it does, but no matter what, I can't see it being below $300 for a very long time. And worst come to worst, I can afford to lose what I've invested in it. Not that it wouldn't sting, but really... anyone whose ever been bullish about BTC selling a losing long-term position JUST above the previous ATH is a bit screwy me thinks...\n",
