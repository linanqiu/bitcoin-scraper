Only the buyers/sellers that visit every market can accurately estimate the average value and price accordingly.

This could either be based on those pesky booth fees or a specifically higher demand in that market for BTC.\n\nYou may be hearing different prices, but until the seller retracts or sells all of their fishes at the $300(ish) price point, that price will not move. That is the new value of the fish. Also, as another point of interest, each market only has a specific buy capacity. This is called the buy wall. Say you have 20 sushi chefs that come to buy about 100 fish in total each day. The guy trying to sell 100,000 fish in that market for an ultra cheap price is very clearly bluffing. Days where there are only 50 fish to sell force the buy wall to incredible heights. Since we can assume that the product (all the same) is not inferior, we can assume ulterior motives by the seller.\n\n",

That is the new value of the fish. Also, as another point of interest, each market only has a specific buy capacity. This is called the buy wall. Say you have 20 sushi chefs that come to buy about 100 fish in total each day. The guy trying to sell 100,000 fish in that market for an ultra cheap price is very clearly bluffing. Days where there are only 50 fish to sell force the buy wall to incredible heights. Since we can assume that the product (all the same) is not inferior, we can assume ulterior motives by the seller.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You put up a huge wall at 320 that you know will not be fulfilled for a while based on trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, someone comes along who wants to sell, notices a large order at 320 that likely isn&amp;#39;t going to be fulfilled for a while, so he prices the coins below that, say 319.  Enough people do that, and these trades get fulfilled while the wall stays up.  Now you withdraw your order, but the recent transactions happen to have been traded at 319.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any new orders at that point are likely to be around 319 even though before the wall, everything was trading at 330.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can now make a large buy to scoop up anything from 319-330 at a discount.  OR you can move the wall down to 300 and pressure the price further down to 299.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
