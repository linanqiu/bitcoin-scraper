If the price of your asset doubles you could readjust this call price by issuing a new asset with a further doubled call price, and paying that as a dividend 1:1 for the initial asset. You would then stop honoring the original asset and pass the equity-torch to the new asset. This is just a though... I haven't seen that discussed just yet.",

This makes it feasible to do even when the call price is low and the Bitcoin fee is significant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to have this sort of linkage, I think it could be done with a contract based on the BTCXCP exchange rate. Nobody is currently offering a broadcast with that information but it is conceivable that someone will offer such broadcasts in the future and build reputation in exchange for a small fee. You could then place a bet, which others could take the other side of, to hedge against BTCXCP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other way to do this is going to be by setting the call price to double what the trading value is now. If the price of your asset doubles you could readjust this call price by issuing a new asset with a further doubled call price, and paying that as a dividend 1:1 for the initial asset. You would then stop honoring the original asset and pass the equity-torch to the new asset. This is just a though... I haven&amp;#39;t seen that discussed just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
