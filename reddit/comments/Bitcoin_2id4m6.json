Bitcoin has been under the radar since 2011 and most probably before that when it was much more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at it in another perspective, if the price goes down to 10$ per Bitcoin, all the vc investments are whipped out. Regulators don&amp;#39;t bother anymore and the Bitcoin protocol lives on to grow again. A possible outcome that would be short lived because the technology would be quickly picked up by other organizations to facilitate transactions with higher velocity and security than the actual financial system does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The right thing is for authority to actually embrace Bitcoin before it evolves into an uncontrollable systems and swallow inflation at the same time. It&amp;#39;s like killing two birds with the same stone... The only problem is, the big guys didn&amp;#39;t see it coming and now they want their fair share of the pie, which seems to be too expensive right now   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In a free market, manipulation is risky, and major manipulation is extremely risky. Put up a giant scare wall and it might work to let you scoop up some cheap coins...or another whale can call your bluff and buy your entire wall, benefitting tremendously from this golden opportunity to buy a huge amount with no slippage. Now you just sold low and will have to buy back high, losing a ton of money in the process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as various tactics get tried, people get wise to them and it becomes a high stakes game of chicken. Whales watch like hawks for opportunities to buy in on the cheap, afforded to them by these manipulation attempts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile holders can just sit back and watch the volatility unfold, knowing that if it really is just manipulation then it&amp;#39;s all temporary anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
