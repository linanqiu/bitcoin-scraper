They can call there customers whatever they want it doe not make it true no more then i can walk into a 747 and claim my drivers license lets me fly a plane.\n\nBFL only got 300 complaints but endless forum/sub posts moaning about them. KNC had loads of whining right up until they shipped then it stopped and has no restarted.\n\nCALL THE FUCKING CONSUMER RIGHTS AUTHORITY FOR SWEDEN. If KNC say you are a business you say you are not and ask them for your business details (company number etc). It is a dumb reason and yet it holds people whose houses are burning down off.\n\nAlso they have to have a refund policy and a return policy under EU law. Even the might Apple got bitchslapped by the EU about this around Applecare which is why Apple kit has a longer warranty in the EU then the U.S (2 vs 1 year IIRC)",

They are also absolutely denying all refund requests, no matter how poor a product they are producing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that no one has complained to the Swedish consumer protection authorities shows how toothless bitcoin miners really are. They can call there customers whatever they want it doe not make it true no more then i can walk into a 747 and claim my drivers license lets me fly a plane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BFL only got 300 complaints but endless forum/sub posts moaning about them. KNC had loads of whining right up until they shipped then it stopped and has no restarted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CALL THE FUCKING CONSUMER RIGHTS AUTHORITY FOR SWEDEN. If KNC say you are a business you say you are not and ask them for your business details (company number etc). It is a dumb reason and yet it holds people whose houses are burning down off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also they have to have a refund policy and a return policy under EU law. Even the might Apple got bitchslapped by the EU about this around Applecare which is why Apple kit has a longer warranty in the EU then the U.S (2 vs 1 year IIRC)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
