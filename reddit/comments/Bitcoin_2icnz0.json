All credit is given to /u/bit_by_bit, who is no longer with us, for providing the original spreadsheet  \n\nThe /u/bit_by_bit spreadsheet has been updated in the following way; no changes were made to any formulas:\n  \n- $/GH cloud rate has been updated to $1/GH, as per Cex.io Website  \n\n\n- Retail-best ASICs have been updated to ASICMiner’s Prisma Unit, [which offers 1TH/s guaranteed for less than 1BTC](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=791827.0). I have been conservative and assumed that 1TH/s will cost exactly 1BTC, which results in a $/GH value of $0.372. To be conservative, I have averaged the Prisma with the other retail industry leader, the Spondoolies SP35, which only slightly outperforms the Antminer S4, but is significantly more expensive from a $/GH point of view than the Prisma unit.  \n\n- Difficulty adjustment history was updated to reflect the latest information  \n\n- Transaction Fee data was updated to reflect the latest information  \n\n- Electricity Prices have been left at $0.1/kWh, despite evidence showing that several miners may be paying half (or less than half) this rate.\n",

All credit is given to &lt;a href=\"/u/bit_by_bit\"&gt;/u/bit_by_bit&lt;/a&gt;, who is no longer with us, for providing the original spreadsheet  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"/u/bit_by_bit\"&gt;/u/bit_by_bit&lt;/a&gt; spreadsheet has been updated in the following way; no changes were made to any formulas:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$/GH cloud rate has been updated to $1/GH, as per Cex.io Website  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail-best ASICs have been updated to ASICMiner’s Prisma Unit, &lt;a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=791827.0\"&gt;which offers 1TH/s guaranteed for less than 1BTC&lt;/a&gt;. I have been conservative and assumed that 1TH/s will cost exactly 1BTC, which results in a $/GH value of $0.372. To be conservative, I have averaged the Prisma with the other retail industry leader, the Spondoolies SP35, which only slightly outperforms the Antminer S4, but is significantly more expensive from a $/GH point of view than the Prisma unit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty adjustment history was updated to reflect the latest information  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction Fee data was updated to reflect the latest information  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electricity Prices have been left at $0.1/kWh, despite evidence showing that several miners may be paying half (or less than half) this rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

                      "body": "&gt; Yesterday I posted this chart showing that bitcoin is trending down (It's been since the end of July), and that it's trending down pretty hard.\n\nSo... you needed a chart to figure that out? :)\n\nAs to the analysis of price, it's relatively easy to show that yours is wrong.\n\nThe price for bitcoin is essentially the price for a virtual commodity. It's determined by supply and demand. It's got some favorable properties valued by whoever builds a utility or value around it for whatever reason.\n\nA commodities price will not \"just go down\" as long as somebody still needs/wants that commodity. In a commodity market, supply follows demand, that is, if say gold is appreciating, more people setup gold mines, which takes time, but eventually they come online, and so supply increases and hence eventually balances demand.\n\nBitcoin is a bit quirky in that respect, it has an inelastic supply. No matter how much or little incentive you give miners to mine it, the amount of bitcoins coming out as a result of that effort is always the same.\n\nHowever, over time, the supply (as a percentage of the circulation) goes down, and it also goes down because of reward halving every 4 years. So it's entirely possible that the demand for bitcoin wanes, and hence the price depreceates. But once that is over, and given enough time, this trend can as well reverse, since, again, the supply is completely inelastic. So once the price reflects a lowered demand, even a small rise in demand can shoot up the price substantially.",
