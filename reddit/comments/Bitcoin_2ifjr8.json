It's a measurement of how many Bitcoin you can obtain for a certain price, because while the price might currently be $325 there isn't enough sell orders to accommodate that price for a large volume, much rather you would need to pay more to get more Bitcoin. \n\nI might of gone a little 12 year old on you there so hopefully you understand.

The term Buy wall or Sell wall come about because it looks literally like a wall on a graph that maps the depth of the order book. Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/XJCZKt6.jpg\"&gt;buy wall that this whale made&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary, &lt;a href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/market/order_book/\"&gt;the order book on Bitstamp currently looks like this.&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a measurement of how many Bitcoin you can obtain for a certain price, because while the price might currently be $325 there isn&amp;#39;t enough sell orders to accommodate that price for a large volume, much rather you would need to pay more to get more Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might of gone a little 12 year old on you there so hopefully you understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On bitstamp you can specify your price up to the nearest cent, which at the current price would be 5 significant figures.\n\nBitcoinity, unlike (say) bitcoinwisdom, will group together latest trades in the history under the same price, so no 2 consecutive trades in the history will appear as the same price. What constitutes the same will be determined by how many significant figures you set your preferences to on the site. Don't believe me? See for yourself - change the number of significant figures you see to 3, then to 5, and you'll see that large orders will be split into smaller numbers. The green and red arrows only indicate movement in the last trade price, not buys/sells.\n\nWhat is going on here is that, since bitstamp allows you to set prices to 5 significant figures, you get a lot of people buying at 300.00 and selling at 299.99. These are reported on bitcoinity (set to 4 sig fig) all at the same price, so all orders within that time period are grouped together and listed as 300.0 which you see on that screenshot. Furthermore, the trade before it of 0.1 at 299.4 was 29 minutes before, which means that the 11362.58 is just the total of all sells made at 299.99 and buys at 300.00 in those 29 minutes. And finally, the video clearly shows that there were long periods of time where the only trades were made at those two prices. Bingo.",
