As an investor that sucks but if we didn&amp;#39;t price things first in dollars, and then calculate thier value based on the &lt;strong&gt;exchange rate in dollars&lt;/strong&gt; or any other currency then, no, we would not have these swings. The supply of bitcoin is finite. It is unique in this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In future in a closed-loop bitcoin only system with no exchanges, price would ONLY fluxuate with the supply of goods snd services and those who wish to use them, which is a much smaller swing than inflationary currency exchange values.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
