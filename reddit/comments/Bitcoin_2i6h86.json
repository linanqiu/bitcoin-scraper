It's about 420 square miles (1100 square kilometers) - so think about a circle with an 11.5 mile radius (19 Km radius).

This is about freedom and the right to vote for who they want (suffrage), and having the people's voice count.  This is about retaining independence.\n\nThe protesters organized and even produced a manual of conduct for *peaceful* protests (do's and don'ts, how to behave when confronted, etc).

The whole idea is radical - if the state comes down on them, then they will garner more sympathy for their cause, because they are doing nothing wrong (or very little).
