As for myself, I&amp;#39;m pretty f&amp;#39;ing &amp;quot;comfortable&amp;quot; with the way things are right now when it comes to &amp;quot;attribution.&amp;quot; For all the trolls in this sub, and all the complaints both valid and invalid, I don&amp;#39;t see anyone here saying &amp;quot;gee I wish there was a way to be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; anonymous with bitcoin!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here we see the proof that this dinosaur still just doesn&amp;#39;t get it. Bitcoin is an open-source P2P technology, run &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; the users and &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the users. Bill Gates and his &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; are mostly irrelevant to its success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can either have (a) the decentralized ledger &amp;amp; transaction network, or (b) a private token system that you can monetize and has all the traceability needed to satisfy your &amp;quot;people.&amp;quot; You get to pick 1, not both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
