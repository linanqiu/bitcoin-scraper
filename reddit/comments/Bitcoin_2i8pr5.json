Proof-of-stake consensus is all the rage, some have even gone so far as to suggest Bitcoin will eventually need to switch over to this type of algorithm. Naturally, then -- seeing that fiat money essentially works the same way as PoS -- the concern would rise, \"if the future of cryptocurrency is PoS, and PoS essentially makes cryptofiat possible, perhaps the future of cryptocurrency is fiatcoin \".\n\nBut the genius behind Bitcoin is, in part, the fact that it separates power over the currency from possession of the currency. This simple but fundamental separation allows Bitcoin to divorce itself from the basic limitation of traditional currency, which is that traditional currency system are owned by someone. Put differently, with fiat and PoS money, once you achieve majority possession of the currency, you simultaneously achieve power over the currency itself (e.g., the power to print money or change the rules governing the currency), and most importantly, that power can never be taken away from you. You simply need to control the majority of units of money and refuse to ever sell them. Money which is by design something that can be ultimately controlled by whomever possesses the majority of coins is really a monetary system that itself can be owned. \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, uses proof-of-work, which separates power over the currency from possession of the currency itself. This was Satoshi Nakamoto's doing. This separation makes it difficult for any party to ever gain permanent control over the currency, as their power can always be usurped by some other entity who manages to put together more hashing power. (What this implies is that eventually mining will no longer be done for profit, but instead will be done out of concerns over national security and power. No nation will be able to afford the threat of allowing any other nation or collection of nations to achieve majority control over the universal currency. People are currently concerned about Bitcoin mining centralization, but this concern will take on a whole new meaning when national security depends upon Bitcoin remaining decentralized. Once Bitcoin becomes large enough that the principle concern over who controls the currency becomes paramount, mining will cease to be done for profit, and will instead be done competitively by nation states, maintaining the system's decentralized nature. We have never seen this kind of relationship to currency before, historically, because there has never been a money which separated power over the currency from the possession of the currency.)\n\nIt is this separation that allows PoW coins to achieve universal status, to work as global money. A global currency simply cannot work with a central authority owning it, it must be decentralized and universal to all. PoS coins, fiat coins, always end with centralization because, as I have said, once someone, or some nation, gains majority possession of the units of money, they control the currency forever. \n\nThe argument for PoS coins replacing PoW coins are fundamentally relying on two points: 1) that all cryptocurrencies, including PoW coins, eventually lead to centralization and 2) that the world will be populated with countless competing currencies. With the ability to effortless exchange these currencies (presumably your wallet would do all the conversions instantly) there is no need for universal currencies . . . effectively all currencies will be universal. \n\nWith regard to #1, while PoS does inevitably lead to centralization, PoW mining does not because mining can be done without concern for profit. (Even in the short term while mining is still done for profit centralization can be avoided.) #2, closed-context currencies (i.e., multiple currencies) depend on forcing people to use those currencies in certain contexts. For example, the US dollar is the only legal currency inside of the United States. Bitshares is required to trade inside the BitsharesX exchange for another example. All of these closed context coins will be like, in a sense, commodities. Some coins will be very liquid, others not so much. Every time you want to exchange from one currency to the other you need to find someone to trade with, someone who happens to want the coin you have in exchange for the coin they have. You can almost imagine the old barter system, where you go to town with your chickens looking to trade for some potatoes, hoping to find someone who is selling potatoes who happens to want chickens. It is just so much simpler if you have money. That is to say, a universal currency becomes the money for cryptocurrency exchange. There will be many currencies, including fiatcoin, but you will still need a kind of super money that serves as a money you can use to easily exchange cryptocurrencies, in the same way gold coins allowed you to easily exchange chickens for potatoes. \n\nPut simply, you need a money for money. Such a super money requires that it be universal, and to be universal it must be decentralized, and to be decentralized it must separate power (over the currency) from possession (of the currency). \n\n(Furthermore, fiat and PoS currencies share the deficit of not being inherently scarce. Fiat money is made of paper and numbers in a computer, and PoS coins lack the basic feature that gives PoW coins their inherent scarcity, namely, the fact that with PoW coins only the top coin of any respective hash algorithm is secure, all competitors lack security and thus die. This means that PoS coins have to be pegged to some underlying system to derive their value which, again, precludes them from attaining universal currency status).\n",

PoS coins, fiat coins, always end with centralization because, as I have said, once someone, or some nation, gains majority possession of the units of money, they control the currency forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument for PoS coins replacing PoW coins are fundamentally relying on two points: 1) that all cryptocurrencies, including PoW coins, eventually lead to centralization and 2) that the world will be populated with countless competing currencies. With the ability to effortless exchange these currencies (presumably your wallet would do all the conversions instantly) there is no need for universal currencies . . . effectively all currencies will be universal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to #1, while PoS does inevitably lead to centralization, PoW mining does not because mining can be done without concern for profit. (Even in the short term while mining is still done for profit centralization can be avoided.) #2, closed-context currencies (i.e., multiple currencies) depend on forcing people to use those currencies in certain contexts. For example, the US dollar is the only legal currency inside of the United States. Bitshares is required to trade inside the BitsharesX exchange for another example. All of these closed context coins will be like, in a sense, commodities. Some coins will be very liquid, others not so much. Every time you want to exchange from one currency to the other you need to find someone to trade with, someone who happens to want the coin you have in exchange for the coin they have. You can almost imagine the old barter system, where you go to town with your chickens looking to trade for some potatoes, hoping to find someone who is selling potatoes who happens to want chickens. It is just so much simpler if you have money. That is to say, a universal currency becomes the money for cryptocurrency exchange. There will be many currencies, including fiatcoin, but you will still need a kind of super money that serves as a money you can use to easily exchange cryptocurrencies, in the same way gold coins allowed you to easily exchange chickens for potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put simply, you need a money for money. Such a super money requires that it be universal, and to be universal it must be decentralized, and to be decentralized it must separate power (over the currency) from possession (of the currency). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Furthermore, fiat and PoS currencies share the deficit of not being inherently scarce. Fiat money is made of paper and numbers in a computer, and PoS coins lack the basic feature that gives PoW coins their inherent scarcity, namely, the fact that with PoW coins only the top coin of any respective hash algorithm is secure, all competitors lack security and thus die. This means that PoS coins have to be pegged to some underlying system to derive their value which, again, precludes them from attaining universal currency status).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
