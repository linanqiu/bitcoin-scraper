They're like a 1 year old  child that hasn't grasped the understanding of good versus bad,  right versus wrong.\n\nI would conservatively put my advice given as being **98% accurate** which puts the bitcoiners who have disagreed with my advice and predictions at being **98% inaccurate** of the time.  \n\nAnd yet I'm the \"troll\".  \n\nSuch foolish, foolish people in this world when it comes to having not a single piece of knowledge when it comes to financial investing. Not a clue.\n\nBitcoiners will just not listen to reason.  \n\nThat is not me  being antagonistic, that is bitcoiners being fools with their money.  \n\n I'm just here trying to help them out.\n\n\n\"Tough love\" is called that because that's exactly what it is and is exactly what bitcoiners need.   That, and sound financial investment advice **which I have given time after time after time.**\n\nBut by all means.... Go ahead and keep touching that hot stove. It's never going to get any cooler.
