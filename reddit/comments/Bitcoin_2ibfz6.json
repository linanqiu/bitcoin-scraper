Replace spreadsheets with Facetime or Youtube or online banking.  The point is that regular people did not have the vision to see how computers would alter the landscape, and therefore could not understand why anyone would spend $3000 on one.  That is why the interviewer is asking Steve Jobs to justify the price, and it's the same question people are always asking about Bitcoin.\n\nRegular people have never had the ability to control their own money online without the permission of a bank.  People have never had the power to transact with any person in any country in any amount at will.
