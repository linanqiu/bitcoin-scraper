I've used wallofcoins.com now five or six times to buy bitcoins and it is mind-blowingly simple. It is so simple that, if you are not new to bitcoin, you might say to yourself \"Where is all the bullshit I'm accustomed to? What happened to all the hoops I have to jump through?\" I recommend that anyone with questions simply connect and buy a small amount of coin. (I wouldn't recommend trying to sell just a small amount of coin because you will only get matched to buyers of equal or smaller amounts since there's no aggregation happening on the buying side, I imagine because to do so would complicate the buyer's experience. At any rate, selling any amount is simple, effective and able to be transparently audited.) There's almost no \"explaining\" the simplicity. I do not miss the hoops or the bullshit and I have practically all but forgotten about other ways to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\nNote: I am not compensated by or affiliated with Wall of Coins however I have met it's creator, this guy Rob, a couple months ago through a mutual good friend. I've been to his company's office in Sarasota, Florida which is about an hour from where I live. I've given him a little feedback while he developed the site and it was in a private beta phase our friend had invited me to. I have no skin in Rob's business beyond that of the obvious benefit that comes with having a quick and easy way to buy coins and super simple way to sell coins while naming my own price. I can also say I meet a lot of nerds through the course of business who talk a big talk and Rob is one of the slim slim few with a real attention to tiny detail, passion for quality and correctness, who has a real understanding of the very many facets of information and financial security.\n\nFYI, I myself am a notorious scam artist and degenerate gambler, so put a dash of salt on my words to fit your taste, but I'm being totally honest. I have never before been able to recommend to new bitcoin users any method of buying or selling other than \"send your money to me and your prayers to God.\" Hahaha.
