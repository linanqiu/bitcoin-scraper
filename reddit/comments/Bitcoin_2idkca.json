That if Bitcoin was worth $10,000 per coin, then Bitcoin has somehow \"won\" the game. And that to invest in Bitcoin means to buy Bitcoin. Well, investing in Bitcoin-the-currency is actually quite different from investing in Bitcoin-the-technology. And speculators are best to speculate on the technology, and not the idea that some other people will buy coins after you did. That's pretty scammy. I could achive the same speculative investing with tulips and baseball cards and beanie babies.\n\nThere are a lot of people who believe in the wrong thing, such as the idea that Marijuana is a dangerous drug and should be illegal. However, with education, real facts and data, we can enlighten those people. I think people are just misinformed about Bitcoin and think that believing in Bitcoin means buying more BTC. We can help spread the right message and prevent unnecessary buying, and thus get towards a steady market.\n\nIt will never be perfect, there will always be misinformed people, but I have faith that as a community, if we work together, we can get people to understand the difference between investing in the Bitcoin technology and throwing money at the Bitcoin currency in hope of riches.",

That if Bitcoin was worth $10,000 per coin, then Bitcoin has somehow &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; the game. And that to invest in Bitcoin means to buy Bitcoin. Well, investing in Bitcoin-the-currency is actually quite different from investing in Bitcoin-the-technology. And speculators are best to speculate on the technology, and not the idea that some other people will buy coins after you did. That&amp;#39;s pretty scammy. I could achive the same speculative investing with tulips and baseball cards and beanie babies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people who believe in the wrong thing, such as the idea that Marijuana is a dangerous drug and should be illegal.
