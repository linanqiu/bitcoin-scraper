But I mentioned a central company as an insurance only as example. What if we gonna build the platform which will allow trustless/decentralized Bitcoin insurance for immediate payments?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E.g. Bob love paying Bitcoins for companies he trust (and Bob wants his product to be shipped immediately almost the next second) But Bob doesn&amp;#39;t like waiting 1-2 Bitcoin confirmations. He has 1 BTC in insurance reserve. Bob can withdraw his BTC only in a specified time window. Once Bob set his insurance reserve, he can forget about it.\nUnconfirmed transactions in Bitcoin arrive to your merchant approximately in 20 seconds, while waiting for Bitcoin Network confirmation usually takes from ~~10 to ~~40 minutes Next time he goes shopping for products with immediate shipping, he just easily pays his 1 BTC to anyone who support immediate payments feature. And once he&amp;#39;s done his payment merchant gets his unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction, next step for merchant is getting that callback URL from insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case if Bob making a double-spending, the system recognizes that &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;reserves his 1 BTC&lt;/strong&gt; to cover double-spend expense When Bob will make a payment from his wallet, his wallet notifies &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; about his original sender to reserve that 1 BTC. Once that 1 BTC is reserved, &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; will send only 1 callback to 1 chosen company. If Bob will send different transactions with the same Bitcoins to the other companies, these companies will receive unconfirmed transactions in their address without knowing that it is a double-spending, but this companies won&amp;#39;t authorize transaction, because these companies won&amp;#39;t receive callback from the service\nIf no one offered this before I will be highly surprised. But anyway I want to raise this topic, because very often I&amp;#39;m inventing the wheels, or maybe today its different? Maybe you would improve something? Or maybe you can finally show me existing service if its exists?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;m wondering, is there any way to build such centralized service which even doesn&amp;#39;t needs user to invest any funds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideas with insurance funds provided by user works good for a long-term, because systems holds his Bitcoin &amp;amp; loses nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my first scheme about this: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/M0YdfLQ\"&gt;http://imgur.com/M0YdfLQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

You're just searching the signature of your transaction in the next block mined.\n\n(2nd Additional transaction) You can actually create CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY transaction without mentioning amount. Instead of amount, you're specifying the signature of your MAIN transaction. Now in second CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY signature Bob has to sign with his private key next strings: SendFrom, SendTo, GetAmountFromTxSignature\n\nGetAmountFromTxSignature is a reference link showing that this is a insurance transaction.\nNow miners can check whether transaction with GetAmountFromTxSignature and they can verify if MAIN transaction has at least 1 confirmation. If there's at least 1 confirmation, then GAFTS transaction is invalidated.\n\nIf Bob network will see two different GAFTS transactions, all of his transactions are invalidated\n\nEDIT: Unfortunately GAFTS thing won't work. That was just a modeling.\n\nThe whole idea can work only within central environment. But Bitcoin is kept decentralized just because insurance company has access only to insurance funds, and as long as insurance company exists, it will have the first vote for chosen merchant. If insurance company is corrupt, then it can send double spent transactions.\n\nNo BIP needed, because unconfirmed transactions are already supported to immediately receive any payment. If callback comes from insurance company, then it means that insurance company recommends your servers to ship product to your customer immediately.",

You&amp;#39;re just searching the signature of your transaction in the next block mined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2nd Additional transaction) You can actually create CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY transaction without mentioning amount. Instead of amount, you&amp;#39;re specifying the signature of your MAIN transaction. Now in second CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY signature Bob has to sign with his private key next strings: SendFrom, SendTo, GetAmountFromTxSignature&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GetAmountFromTxSignature is a reference link showing that this is a insurance transaction.\nNow miners can check whether transaction with GetAmountFromTxSignature and they can verify if MAIN transaction has at least 1 confirmation. If there&amp;#39;s at least 1 confirmation, then GAFTS transaction is invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Bob network will see two different GAFTS transactions, all of his transactions are invalidated&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Unfortunately GAFTS thing won&amp;#39;t work. That was just a modeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole idea can work only within central environment. But Bitcoin is kept decentralized just because insurance company has access only to insurance funds, and as long as insurance company exists, it will have the first vote for chosen merchant. If insurance company is corrupt, then it can send double spent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No BIP needed, because unconfirmed transactions are already supported to immediately receive any payment. If callback comes from insurance company, then it means that insurance company recommends your servers to ship product to your customer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
