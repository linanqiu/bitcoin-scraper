The right to due process and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty underpin the entire judicial system FFS!\n\n\n **[+10] rustyrebar**: \n&gt;This has become standard practice.  People have sums as small as $5,000 seized by cops with little hope of ever recovering the money, at least not a cost that makes it worth it.  If you have to spend $3000 on a lawyer to get your $5000 back, it is not worth it, especially when you consider all the time it takes, and you are still not cretin to get it back.  Meanwhile this money goes directly to the coffers of the department it was seized by, thereby giving them incentive to do this.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is literally the definition of highway robbery.  They just pull you over, make up some suspicion, take your money and you can figure it out in court over the next three years at extensive cost.  There is no downside for them.\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2014/03/12/cops-use-traffic-stops-to-seize-millions-from-drivers-never-charged-with-a-crime/\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.ij.org/policing-for-profit-the-abuse-of-civil-asset-forfeiture-4\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2014/09/29/highway-cash-seizures-civil-forfeiture/\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-texas-profiling_wittmar10-story.html#page=1\n&gt;\n&gt;http://hamptonroads.com/2014/09/highway-robbery-police-seizures-cash-escalate\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.stwnewspress.com/cnhi_network/article_daf14bbf-a3d4-51cb-9013-73b55f00edd7.html\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Property-seized-by-E-Texas-police-called-1732387.php\n&gt;\n&gt;That is just a couple results for a simple Google search.\n\n\n **[+16] Guy_Dudebro**: \n&gt;The thing to take away from this is leave as soon as you're told the stop is over.
