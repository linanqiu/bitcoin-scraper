            "body": "You ask an interesting question but I think you need to first of all identify the wallets holding the largest amounts of bitcoin and consider their activity and their ownership. The largest 100 bitcoin addresses (by size of holding) seems to me to be relatively active (generaly, i.e. most have recent transactions) and many of them appear to be interlinked. Large sums (mainly) moving between them. I concluded a lot of them are under the control/ownership of one entity. More research is required in this area, it is quite time consuming to unmix the activity but it would be good to get to the bottom of it because I have a feeling something like 50-75% of the *active* bitcoins are under the control of a single person or company and we have no idea who it is or what they are up to.",

The largest 100 bitcoin addresses (by size of holding) seems to me to be relatively active (generaly, i.e. most have recent transactions) and many of them appear to be interlinked. Large sums (mainly) moving between them. I concluded a lot of them are under the control/ownership of one entity.
