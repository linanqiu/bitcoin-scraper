Bitcoin grows with several hype bubbles, after each the price collapses (but way above the original numbers) and then lies dormant for months, often while new software is being developed, new partnerships created, new investments made, and then something pushes it further to a new hype bubble.\n\nThat would make sense except even the Paypal announcement and other big news made the price go even lower.  \n\n&gt;  An ecosystem where big cities had their own ATM, \n\nLike the ATMs that are already being sold?\n\n&gt; where governments acknowledged it and \n\nLike the videos from the Bank of England?  The number of positive leaning assessments from the Federal Reserve?  \n\n\n&gt; technology legends praise it.\n\nLike Bill Gates?  \n\nThe price is dictated by the demand.

            "body": "If you look at the 'return to the mean' and look at the trend over the past 5 years, we're pretty much there right now. Bitcoin grows with several hype bubbles, after each the price collapses (but way above the original numbers) and then lies dormant for months, often while new software is being developed, new partnerships created, new investments made, and then something pushes it further to a new hype bubble.\n\nAnyway what will happen, I don't know, but I'm seeing a genuine ecosystem for the first time. I'm seeing lots of cool companies participating, both new, fringe, scrappy, as well as professional, as well as highly traditional incumbents.\n\n Let's face it, this was always what we wanted, an ecosystem where we could actually have deterministic wallets that are secured with multi-sig, an ecosystem where you could instantly buy bitcoin for free, an ecosystem where you had billion dollar retailers letting you buy food, electronics, hotels, flights, games, clothes, porn and books. An ecosystem where big cities had their own ATM, where governments acknowledged it and technology legends praise it.\n\nI'm really glad to see bitcoin where it is today. I'd rather have all this and a price that's 3x the level of last year, than none of this and a price 10 times the level of last year.\n\nIf you're really only in this for the money, frankly I don't care for your opinion. That's a valid interest, but take it to bitcoin markets. On this subreddit I want to discuss the impact of bitcoin. \n\nAnd if there's one thing you should know by now, price is a good proxy over long periods of time, in specific moments, it's a shitty proxy for the health and impact of bitcoin. This very fact is what sparked all the recent jokes like 'Paypal integrates bitcoin, look out, price crash incoming!' because price and good news have been disconnected for months. \n\nSo why focus on a metric that is a bad proxy for the thing we care about?

Bitcoin grows with several hype bubbles, after each the price collapses (but way above the original numbers) and then lies dormant for months, often while new software is being developed, new partnerships created, new investments made, and then something pushes it further to a new hype bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway what will happen, I don&amp;#39;t know, but I&amp;#39;m seeing a genuine ecosystem for the first time. I&amp;#39;m seeing lots of cool companies participating, both new, fringe, scrappy, as well as professional, as well as highly traditional incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it, this was always what we wanted, an ecosystem where we could actually have deterministic wallets that are secured with multi-sig, an ecosystem where you could instantly buy bitcoin for free, an ecosystem where you had billion dollar retailers letting you buy food, electronics, hotels, flights, games, clothes, porn and books. An ecosystem where big cities had their own ATM, where governments acknowledged it and technology legends praise it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really glad to see bitcoin where it is today. I&amp;#39;d rather have all this and a price that&amp;#39;s 3x the level of last year, than none of this and a price 10 times the level of last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re really only in this for the money, frankly I don&amp;#39;t care for your opinion. That&amp;#39;s a valid interest, but take it to bitcoin markets. On this subreddit I want to discuss the impact of bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if there&amp;#39;s one thing you should know by now, price is a good proxy over long periods of time, in specific moments, it&amp;#39;s a shitty proxy for the health and impact of bitcoin.
