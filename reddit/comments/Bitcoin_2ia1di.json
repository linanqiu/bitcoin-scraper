I was talking about the \"cost per transaction\" stat on blockchain.info, not how miners behave or operate. \n\nAlso if they are doing 10% and getting 250 BTC a day, they are getting that amount (plus fees) no matter if there is 100 transactions or 100,000. When the block reward halves, if they want to keep getting that full 250 like you mention, either transaction volume would have to increase an insane amount and/or transaction fees would have to be way way higher. It doesnt really cost anything to include more transactions in a block (to a point), so I dont think we will see miners just ignoring transactions that dont have a much higher fee, unless it is at a point where there are so many transactions being made constantly that block space actually becomes competitive.",

I was talking about the &amp;quot;cost per transaction&amp;quot; stat on blockchain.info, not how miners behave or operate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if they are doing 10% and getting 250 BTC a day, they are getting that amount (plus fees) no matter if there is 100 transactions or 100,000. When the block reward halves, if they want to keep getting that full 250 like you mention, either transaction volume would have to increase an insane amount and/or transaction fees would have to be way way higher. It doesnt really cost anything to include more transactions in a block (to a point), so I dont think we will see miners just ignoring transactions that dont have a much higher fee, unless it is at a point where there are so many transactions being made constantly that block space actually becomes competitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Who will back up bitcoin if it crashes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free and easy? The electricity to mine or the computers to verify aren&amp;#39;t free. And it definitely isn&amp;#39;t easy as it requires a global network of computers coming together in one of the largest concentrations of computing power ever assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security seems pretty solid. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably this is a flaw in that growth of supply will at some point fall short of growth of producitivity and value. This will lead toward the &amp;#39;value&amp;#39; of a money unit to increase creating potentially interesting situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human existence is not necessarily algorithmic....though I would probably argue the opposite at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely not cheap - right now the costs are being underwritten through mining, however, that will fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarcity might be a long term issue. Money should align with the value of work and &amp;#39;things&amp;#39; in society, not the other way around. Money has no value - it is representative of the things that do. So to have a money that suddenly stops aligning itself in volume with available value is a challenge. One of many reasons we left the gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authentication - good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
