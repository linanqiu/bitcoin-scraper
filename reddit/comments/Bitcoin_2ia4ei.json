You clearly couldn't grasp that despite me writing it pretty plainly. And then when I continued to repeat it.\n&gt;The price is largely irrelevant to the technology\n\nI'm bored of this, I'm sure you arguing that there are some edge cases, where people who aren't speculating give a shit about the price, will make you feel all warm and fuzzy as the price plummets.",
