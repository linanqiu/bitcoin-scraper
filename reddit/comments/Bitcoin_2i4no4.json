They could always rollback the ledger in a rare instance where they are hacked.\n\nCold storage is now a norm for exchanges, which implies that they do not believe that they can keep their online wallets secure. Or, at least, they do not want to rely on it.\n\nRunning a private accounting server is not unlike running an online wallet. And thus operator should take into account that server might be hijacked at some point. (I'd don't think it is so rare: how many exchanges were hacked or \"hacked\"?)\n\nSo it makes sense to reduce risks as much as possible. Keeping a complete log of all transactions is better than keeping only balances from this perspective: having a log, you can find the point of intrusion and roll back to it.\n\nIt's even better if this transaction log is securely timestamped, as it might help in the case attacker will try to double-spend his coins rather than create coins our of thin air. Also it might help if this log is accessible to all users, so they can verify it themselves. Also you need to be sure that this log is safely preserved. Yes you can just back it up, but imagine a rogue system operator wants to destroy your system, quite likely he has access both to the live system and its backups, and he will be able to destroy backups too.\n\nHmm, an append-only transaction log, which is securely timestamped, accessible to all interested parties, and is preserved (ideally, forever), does it remind you of something?\n\nSure, you can make your own blockchain and use Bitcoin network for timestamping purposes by putting hashes into Bitcoin blocks. But in that case you would need a separate backup solution.\n\nEven if it's not that hard to make a system which provides security roughly equivalent to the blockchain, why bother if you can just outsource it to the blockchain?\n\n&gt; Trying to make the system trustless seems pointless if Reddit has to approve every transaction.\n\nThe point here is not so much in trustlessness, as it is in absolving Reddit of the responsibility to process trade transactions.\n\nThere are both regulatory issues (if you are processing payments, then you're essentially a broker-dealer, and might need to comply with laws), and security issues (is something goes awry, who's responsible?).\n\n&gt; I suppose the idea of outsourcing security and trading to a decentralized blockchain instead of trusting someone else could be a benefit as well.

They could always rollback the ledger in a rare instance where they are hacked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cold storage is now a norm for exchanges, which implies that they do not believe that they can keep their online wallets secure. Or, at least, they do not want to rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running a private accounting server is not unlike running an online wallet. And thus operator should take into account that server might be hijacked at some point. (I&amp;#39;d don&amp;#39;t think it is so rare: how many exchanges were hacked or &amp;quot;hacked&amp;quot;?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it makes sense to reduce risks as much as possible. Keeping a complete log of all transactions is better than keeping only balances from this perspective: having a log, you can find the point of intrusion and roll back to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s even better if this transaction log is securely timestamped, as it might help in the case attacker will try to double-spend his coins rather than create coins our of thin air. Also it might help if this log is accessible to all users, so they can verify it themselves. Also you need to be sure that this log is safely preserved.
