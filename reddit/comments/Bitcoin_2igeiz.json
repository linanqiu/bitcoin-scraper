Think about it; learning a complicated hodgepodge of backwards hex values and zero tolerance for txn compilation, all to bring a service/business to the masses who aren't even sure why they need it.\n\nMy vision for Bitcoin is dependent on these rough edges being smoothed out so there is no broken Altavista links or limited availability on dialup modems; because that's where we are now. We're not even Windows95, we're just past Win 3.1.1 (MS-DOS being the complicated hodgepodge to the mishmash of APIs running today's apps). \n\nTeaching people about Bitcoin will be incredibly useful, and, rewarding! First hand feedback on what prevents mass adoption helps guide development. And on that note, consider the developers like Gavin and Andreas who are incredible positive role models. I will be buying Andreas' book to support his tireless lecturing and speaker engagements.
