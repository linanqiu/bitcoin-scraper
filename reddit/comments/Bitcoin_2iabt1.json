The sad part is that there are so many \"fans\" who dont care about technology and only about money. They will defend bitcoin to the death instead of supporting the technology. BitUSD for example is so much better that bitcoin in any way. Faster transactions, stable price backed by bitshares. Bitcoin is altavista in my opinion.
