A growing number of proponents support its use as an alternative currency that can pay for goods and services much like conventional currencies. Bitcoin is the first and easily the most popular cryptocurrency, cryptocoin, or currency that uses cryptography to control its creation, administration, and security. Bitcoin with a capital “B” is considered the Public Ledger and bitcoin with a lower case “b” are considered the currency\n\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown, mysterious individual or group with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is yet to be revealed and who left the project in 2010\n\n\n* Bitcoin uses P2P technology without a central authority: Bitcoin is a decentralized currency managed by peer-to-peer technology (P2P), without a central authority. All functions such as Bitcoin issuance, transaction processing and verification are carried out collectively by the network, without a central supervisor or agency to oversee operations.\n* Bitcoin is digital: Bitcoin has been designed to be a digital currency that prevents double spending.\n* Bitcoin has a maximum 21 million limit: The total number of bitcoins that will be issued is capped at 21 million. The Bitcoin “mining” process presently creates 25 bitcoins approx. every 10 minutes (the number created will be halved every four years), so that limit will not be reached until the year 2140. A bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, the number of fractional bitcoins (called “satoshis”) – at 21 x 10^14 – will be more than enough for all conceivable applications.\n* Bitcoin transactions have limitations: A bitcoin transaction can take as long as approx. 10 minutes to confirm. Transactions are also irreversible and can only be refunded by the bitcoin recipient. Zero (0) confirmations are ok for smaller purchase transactions but this depends on the recipient if they will take this risk not unlike with credit cards acceptance\n* Bitcoin balances are not insured: This means that if you lose your bitcoins private keys for any reason – for example, your hard drive crashes, or a hacker steals from the digital wallet in which your bitcoins are stored, or the bitcoin exchange where you held a balance went out of business – you have little recourse but new companies are starting up everyday and one may work as an insure\n* Bitcoin uses public key encryption techniques for security: This means that when a new bitcoin address is created, a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and private key – which are essentially unique, long strings of letters and numbers – is generated\n* Bitcoin mining: Bitcoin mining is the terminology used to describe the world wide P2P network of computers that are used to verify the bitcoin transactions in the blockchain. At this time it is not recommended to mine with a computer (CPU) or video cards (GPU) as to the current difficulty. Currently bitcoin mining is done with Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips at a high cost. We recommend you do your research on bitcoin mining as you may not make your return on investment (ROI). It is also recommended you do not pre-pay for ACIS’s as some suppliers have not made promised delivery dates or have not ship at all. After 2140, the bitcoin network miners will be incentivized with transaction fees just as the credit card networks are now\n\n\n\nAll bitcoin transactions, without exception, are included in a shared public transaction log known as a “blockchain”. This is to confirm that the party spending the bitcoins really owns them, and also to prevent fraud and double-spending.\n\n\n*Bitcoin has a number of advantages:*\n\n\n* As the first cryptocoin to capture the public imagination, Bitcoin has “first mover” advantage and a  head start over the competition\n* Total issuance is limited to 21 million, so it is unlikely to be devalued because of the prospect of a  massive influx of new bitcoins\n* As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is free from government interference and manipulation.\n* Transaction costs are much lower than with conventional currencies.\n\n\n*On the flip side, Bitcoin’s disadvantages include:*\n\n\n* The price of a bitcoin has been volatile and increasing the risk of losses for investors in the  cryptocoins\n* The relative anonymity of Bitcoin may encourage its use for illegal and illicit activities such as tax  evasion, illegal weapons procurement, gambling and circumvention of currency controls but less  likely then physical cash\n\n\n**How to use bitcoin as a consumer when purchasing to limit volatility**\n\nNow you’re asking, why would I use bitcoin as a consumer as the bitcoin price fluctuates from what all merchants sell their merchandise or service for? As stated in part by this [Blog post](http://bitcoinbakersfield.com/blog-page2.htm#blog-5-28-2014-Why-use-Bitcoin), using bitcoin as payment, you do not need to give the merchants your personal credit or debit card financial information so no risk of identity theft like what has happened with US companies of Target, Michael's, and PF Chang’s and you help avoid credit debt, and as bitcoin become more accepted throughout the world, you no longer need to exchange your currency to a foreign currency when traveling.\n\n\nThe best way to use bitcoin is sort of a like using a prepaid credit card or debit card as bitcoin is not controlled by any centralized bank or government, so you must also control purchase volatility. To do this, you must be a simple investor or holder of no more than the amount of bitcoin you may use as a consumer. This could be $20, $50, or $200. This amount can then be stored in a wallet on your phone or computer. When you use bitcoin, you just recharge or *buy back* (obtain) the amount of bitcoin you use at the time of each merchant purchase.\n\n\nSay you now have $100 (USD) in bitcoin on your phone or computer wallet and you find something on the Internet for $20.25. This will bring you to about $79.75 in bitcoin after the purchase. Once you complete your purchase you will need to recharge or obtain back the approximate amount of bitcoin of $20.25 so you are now approximately back to $100 in bitcoin or at least the amount of bitcoin used. Say your purchase for $20.25 was 0.00215 bitcoin. You just recharge or obtain the 0.00215 bitcoin. I personally am also a very small investor of bitcoin and always recharge or obtain a little more bitcoin so I would have obtained .0022 bitcoin after the merchant purchase of the item(s).\n\n\nThis separates your investment form your currency. The $20.25 purchase was and always will be $20.25.\n\n\nYou may have been told the story of the person that purchased a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins. At the time, 10,000 bitcoins would have been about $20.00 or so. Most people now in July 2014, state this is a $6,000,000 (USD) pizza but if this person recharged or obtained 10,000 more bitcoins just after this purchase, they would have a $20.00 pizza and still have the 10,000 bitcoin investment they could cash in for $6,000,000 (USD) today (July 2014).\n\n\n\nSo using Bitcoin like this is like using a prepaid credit card but with the added advantage of future gains but you could lose your investment if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes down but you still have the benefit of a layer of financial identity protection.\n\n\n\nAnother point we must state is recharging or obtaining replacement bitcoins after each purchase may cost you more then the purchase price of the product by as low as $0.04 or maybe over $2.00 as to buy / sell spread from your exchange you use to obtain bitcoin from and miners fees but you save on the cost of purchasing identify theft protection and/or your own personal time fixing any financial identity issues. \n\n\nYou may also need to adjust your holdings of bitcoin if the exchange rate of bitcoin drops or you start using bitcoin for larger and larger cost merchant purchases.",

A growing number of proponents support its use as an alternative currency that can pay for goods and services much like conventional currencies. Bitcoin is the first and easily the most popular cryptocurrency, cryptocoin, or currency that uses cryptography to control its creation, administration, and security. Bitcoin with a capital “B” is considered the Public Ledger and bitcoin with a lower case “b” are considered the currency&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown, mysterious individual or group with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is yet to be revealed and who left the project in 2010&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin uses P2P technology without a central authority: Bitcoin is a decentralized currency managed by peer-to-peer technology (P2P), without a central authority. All functions such as Bitcoin issuance, transaction processing and verification are carried out collectively by the network, without a central supervisor or agency to oversee operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is digital: Bitcoin has been designed to be a digital currency that prevents double spending.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin has a maximum 21 million limit: The total number of bitcoins that will be issued is capped at 21 million. The Bitcoin “mining” process presently creates 25 bitcoins approx. every 10 minutes (the number created will be halved every four years), so that limit will not be reached until the year 2140. A bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, the number of fractional bitcoins (called “satoshis”) – at 21 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; – will be more than enough for all conceivable applications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin transactions have limitations: A bitcoin transaction can take as long as approx. 10 minutes to confirm. Transactions are also irreversible and can only be refunded by the bitcoin recipient. Zero (0) confirmations are ok for smaller purchase transactions but this depends on the recipient if they will take this risk not unlike with credit cards acceptance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin balances are not insured: This means that if you lose your bitcoins private keys for any reason – for example, your hard drive crashes, or a hacker steals from the digital wallet in which your bitcoins are stored, or the bitcoin exchange where you held a balance went out of business – you have little recourse but new companies are starting up everyday and one may work as an insure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin uses public key encryption techniques for security: This means that when a new bitcoin address is created, a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and private key – which are essentially unique, long strings of letters and numbers – is generated&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin mining: Bitcoin mining is the terminology used to describe the world wide P2P network of computers that are used to verify the bitcoin transactions in the blockchain. At this time it is not recommended to mine with a computer (CPU) or video cards (GPU) as to the current difficulty. Currently bitcoin mining is done with Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips at a high cost. We recommend you do your research on bitcoin mining as you may not make your return on investment (ROI). It is also recommended you do not pre-pay for ACIS’s as some suppliers have not made promised delivery dates or have not ship at all. After 2140, the bitcoin network miners will be incentivized with transaction fees just as the credit card networks are now&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All bitcoin transactions, without exception, are included in a shared public transaction log known as a “blockchain”. This is to confirm that the party spending the bitcoins really owns them, and also to prevent fraud and double-spending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin has a number of advantages:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As the first cryptocoin to capture the public imagination, Bitcoin has “first mover” advantage and a  head start over the competition&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Total issuance is limited to 21 million, so it is unlikely to be devalued because of the prospect of a  massive influx of new bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is free from government interference and manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transaction costs are much lower than with conventional currencies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the flip side, Bitcoin’s disadvantages include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The price of a bitcoin has been volatile and increasing the risk of losses for investors in the  cryptocoins&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The relative anonymity of Bitcoin may encourage its use for illegal and illicit activities such as tax  evasion, illegal weapons procurement, gambling and circumvention of currency controls but less  likely then physical cash&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use bitcoin as a consumer when purchasing to limit volatility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you’re asking, why would I use bitcoin as a consumer as the bitcoin price fluctuates from what all merchants sell their merchandise or service for? As stated in part by this &lt;a href=\"http://bitcoinbakersfield.com/blog-page2.htm#blog-5-28-2014-Why-use-Bitcoin\"&gt;Blog post&lt;/a&gt;, using bitcoin as payment, you do not need to give the merchants your personal credit or debit card financial information so no risk of identity theft like what has happened with US companies of Target, Michael&amp;#39;s, and PF Chang’s and you help avoid credit debt, and as bitcoin become more accepted throughout the world, you no longer need to exchange your currency to a foreign currency when traveling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to use bitcoin is sort of a like using a prepaid credit card or debit card as bitcoin is not controlled by any centralized bank or government, so you must also control purchase volatility. To do this, you must be a simple investor or holder of no more than the amount of bitcoin you may use as a consumer. This could be $20, $50, or $200. This amount can then be stored in a wallet on your phone or computer. When you use bitcoin, you just recharge or &lt;em&gt;buy back&lt;/em&gt; (obtain) the amount of bitcoin you use at the time of each merchant purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say you now have $100 (USD) in bitcoin on your phone or computer wallet and you find something on the Internet for $20.25. This will bring you to about $79.75 in bitcoin after the purchase. Once you complete your purchase you will need to recharge or obtain back the approximate amount of bitcoin of $20.25 so you are now approximately back to $100 in bitcoin or at least the amount of bitcoin used. Say your purchase for $20.25 was 0.00215 bitcoin. You just recharge or obtain the 0.00215 bitcoin. I personally am also a very small investor of bitcoin and always recharge or obtain a little more bitcoin so I would have obtained .0022 bitcoin after the merchant purchase of the item(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This separates your investment form your currency. The $20.25 purchase was and always will be $20.25.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may have been told the story of the person that purchased a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins. At the time, 10,000 bitcoins would have been about $20.00 or so. Most people now in July 2014, state this is a $6,000,000 (USD) pizza but if this person recharged or obtained 10,000 more bitcoins just after this purchase, they would have a $20.00 pizza and still have the 10,000 bitcoin investment they could cash in for $6,000,000 (USD) today (July 2014).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So using Bitcoin like this is like using a prepaid credit card but with the added advantage of future gains but you could lose your investment if the exchange rate of bitcoin goes down but you still have the benefit of a layer of financial identity protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another point we must state is recharging or obtaining replacement bitcoins after each purchase may cost you more then the purchase price of the product by as low as $0.04 or maybe over $2.00 as to buy / sell spread from your exchange you use to obtain bitcoin from and miners fees but you save on the cost of purchasing identify theft protection and/or your own personal time fixing any financial identity issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may also need to adjust your holdings of bitcoin if the exchange rate of bitcoin drops or you start using bitcoin for larger and larger cost merchant purchases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
