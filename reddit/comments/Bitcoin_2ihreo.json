                      "body": "&gt;Some unusually large sell orders put bitcoin through a wild ride Sunday and Monday, highlighting what bitcoin advocates say is a need for advanced investing facilities to boost volumes and tame the extreme volatility in the digital currency’s thinly traded market. Late afternoon in New York Monday, bitcoin was trading up 3.69% on the day at $331.45, according to Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. \n\n&gt;In the early hours of Asian trading it had dropped to $301.29, in a brief revival of some of the furious selling seen on online markets Sunday, when the price fell as low as $286.56. That low point represents a 75% decline from the peak Of $1,165.89 that bitcoin hit on Nov. 30 last year but is still almost three times the $99 price at which it traded this time last year. \n\n&gt;The catalyst for the latest bout of selling appears to have been a 30,000-bitcoin sell order priced at $300, which surfaced Sunday morning on Slovenia-based exchange BitStamp. That one order represented twice the normal volume on BitStamp, one of the more liquid of various online exchanges for the virtual currency. The order was later withdrawn but reappeared temporarily at different levels. The supposed attempt to sell $9 million worth of the digital currency spooked investors into a flight from bitcoin. \n\n&gt;According Bitcoinwisdom.com, total volume on the 12 exchanges it tracks ran to around 640,000 bitcoins over the 24 hours to 1 p.m. EDT Monday, more than 3½ times the daily average of the past 30 days. Matt Odell, co-founder and executive editor of market analytics firm Coinprices.com, said the seller’s placement on an open exchange suggested a large player was attempting to manipulate the price. A smart investor who wanted to legitimately unload holdings would have done so in an over-the-counter market where their actions are not displayed to the broader marketplace to avoid making the price move against them, he said. “Just selling half of that order would have totally crashed the price of bitcoin,” Mr. Odell said, adding that he suspected the quickly withdrawn offer was placed by a large player such as an exchange, which may have needed to meet a large order from a customer. \n\n&gt;By temporarily driving down the price, this large player would be able to buy bitcoins at the lower level and so fill the order cheaply. There were other sources of ongoing selling pressure. Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket Inc. and a prominent bitcoin advocate, said some U.S. investors are selling bitcoin to finance tax bills due Oct. 15—the expiration date for the six-month extensions filed after the Internal Revenue Service announced in the spring that bitcoin sales would be subject to capital gains tax. “There are people with sizable tax bills,” Mr. Silbert said, the profit accumulation “goes all the way back to 2009.” Bitcoin investors are also generally concerned that regulators are taking a tougher stance globally. Russia’s government announced a bill over the weekend that, if passed, would declare any “money substitutes” illegal. But if these factors invite sellers into bitcoin and keep buyers at bay, it is the lack of volume that exacerbates the market reaction. \n\n&gt;The combined average daily turnover on the biggest bitcoin exchanges runs to $60 million at current prices. By comparison, more than $5 trillion changes hands daily in the world’s traditional currency markets. The thin bitcoin volume fosters volatility, which in turn decreases the digital currency’s appeal as a payments vehicle, even though merchants are increasingly making it available as an option for shoppers. One way to resolve that would be to draw bigger investors into the market. And by many accounts, there continues to be interest from institutional and wealthy investors who have been otherwise locked out of the market because the infrastructure isn’t developed enough. \n\n&gt;New York-based bitcoin derivatives provider SolidX Partners Inc. is among various startups seeking to address that. The firm says that in response to demand from its hedge fund clients it is developing dollar-denominated total return swaps based off bitcoin’s price. By giving these investors a familiar instrument to trade without having to own bitcoin outright, SolidX will bring in “a whole other pool of capital that can, depending on what’s going on, provide support or provide price pressure,” said Chief Executive Daniel H. Gallancy.\n\nBecause paragraphs.",

In the early hours of Asian trading it had dropped to $301.29, in a brief revival of some of the furious selling seen on online markets Sunday, when the price fell as low as $286.56. That low point represents a 75% decline from the peak Of $1,165.89 that bitcoin hit on Nov. 30 last year but is still almost three times the $99 price at which it traded this time last year.\nThe catalyst for the latest bout of selling appears to have been a 30,000-bitcoin sell order priced at $300, which surfaced Sunday morning on Slovenia-based exchange BitStamp. That one order represented twice the normal volume on BitStamp, one of the more liquid of various online exchanges for the virtual currency. The order was later withdrawn but reappeared temporarily at different levels.\nThe supposed attempt to sell $9 million worth of the digital currency spooked investors into a flight from bitcoin. According Bitcoinwisdom.com, total volume on the 12 exchanges it tracks ran to around 640,000 bitcoins over the 24 hours to 1 p.m. EDT Monday, more than 3½ times the daily average of the past 30 days.\nMatt Odell, co-founder and executive editor of market analytics firm Coinprices.com, said the seller’s placement on an open exchange suggested a large player was attempting to manipulate the price. A smart investor who wanted to legitimately unload holdings would have done so in an over-the-counter market where their actions are not displayed to the broader marketplace to avoid making the price move against them, he said.\n“Just selling half of that order would have totally crashed the price of bitcoin,” Mr. Odell said, adding that he suspected the quickly withdrawn offer was placed by a large player such as an exchange, which may have needed to meet a large order from a customer. By temporarily driving down the price, this large player would be able to buy bitcoins at the lower level and so fill the order cheaply.\nThere were other sources of ongoing selling pressure. Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket Inc. and a prominent bitcoin advocate, said some U.S. investors are selling bitcoin to finance tax bills due Oct. 15—the expiration date for the six-month extensions filed after the Internal Revenue Service announced in the spring that bitcoin sales would be subject to capital gains tax. “There are people with sizable tax bills,” Mr. Silbert said, the profit accumulation “goes all the way back to 2009.”\nBitcoin investors are also generally concerned that regulators are taking a tougher stance globally. Russia’s government announced a bill over the weekend that, if passed, would declare any “money substitutes” illegal.\nBut if these factors invite sellers into bitcoin and keep buyers at bay, it is the lack of volume that exacerbates the market reaction. The combined average daily turnover on the biggest bitcoin exchanges runs to $60 million at current prices. By comparison, more than $5 trillion changes hands daily in the world’s traditional currency markets. The thin bitcoin volume fosters volatility, which in turn decreases the digital currency’s appeal as a payments vehicle, even though merchants are increasingly making it available as an option for shoppers.\nOne way to resolve that would be to draw bigger investors into the market. And by many accounts, there continues to be interest from institutional and wealthy investors who have been otherwise locked out of the market because the infrastructure isn’t developed enough.\nNew York-based bitcoin derivatives provider SolidX Partners Inc. is among various startups seeking to address that. The firm says that in response to demand from its hedge fund clients it is developing dollar-denominated total return swaps based off bitcoin’s price. By giving these investors a familiar instrument to trade without having to own bitcoin outright, SolidX will bring in “a whole other pool of capital that can, depending on what’s going on, provide support or provide price pressure,” said Chief Executive Daniel H. Gallancy.",
