However we generally agree that some addresses are too off-the-wall for anybody to actually have the private key for it.  This is kinda the same concept that protects all of our funds...  \nBasically talked about in this infographic: https://i.imgur.com/CzyO1yv.jpg\n\nSo for addresses like [1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr](http://btc.blockr.io/address/info/1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr) and [1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE](http://btc.blockr.io/address/info/1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE) we all just agree that nobody would have the private key to those addresses.  (The last 5 digits of an address must be a correct hash of everything that comes before it or gets rejected by the network).   \n\nOn a related note is something like [vanitygen](https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen/blob/master/README) where you can keep cranking out private keys until you find the associated address that looks good for you.  For instance, creating 1BTC followed by random characters might take 30 seconds, depending on the speed of your computer, and 1judah...... might take 30 minutes.  But we assume there hasn't been enough time so far to have created the non random \"bitcoin eater\" address.\n\n",

            "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A private key is a number.  One cannot prove that a number doesn&amp;#39;t exist.  However we generally agree that some addresses are too off-the-wall for anybody to actually have the private key for it.  This is kinda the same concept that protects all of our funds...&lt;br/&gt;\nBasically talked about in this infographic: &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/CzyO1yv.jpg\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/CzyO1yv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for addresses like &lt;a href=\"http://btc.blockr.io/address/info/1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr\"&gt;1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://btc.blockr.io/address/info/1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE\"&gt;1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE&lt;/a&gt; we all just agree that nobody would have the private key to those addresses.  (The last 5 digits of an address must be a correct hash of everything that comes before it or gets rejected by the network).   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a related note is something like &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen/blob/master/README\"&gt;vanitygen&lt;/a&gt; where you can keep cranking out private keys until you find the associated address that looks good for you.  For instance, creating 1BTC followed by random characters might take 30 seconds, depending on the speed of your computer, and 1judah...... might take 30 minutes.  But we assume there hasn&amp;#39;t been enough time so far to have created the non random &amp;quot;bitcoin eater&amp;quot; address.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
