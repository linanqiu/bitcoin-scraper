I&amp;#39;ve been watching a lot of the LCS(League of legends championship) this week and see all these sponsors for teams. Like Samsung blue and white (teams that are in the finals). I think it would be really easy for us to work together and sponsor a team of our own! This could be an awesome project where not only btc can sponsor but ltc, doge, etc can be a part of the team too! A little into details here I seen that roughly 300k people watch the LCS a night. Also we can have the individual players help support us on their own stream on twitch which has roughly 10-12k viewers depending on the player. I think this would be an awesome step in the right direction for all of us to work towards. Star craft 2 tournaments already have bitcoin grand prizes. Why not take a step forward and create our own team? What do you guys think? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
