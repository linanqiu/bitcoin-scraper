What people want and expect to happen, and what will actually happen are two different things I believe. \n\nThe tl;dr answer is a) [people tend to overestimate technology in the short run but wildly underestimate it in the long run](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2014/10/05/krugmania-as-bitcoins-price-falls-the-nyt-pundit-takes-a-very-premature-victory-lap/) and b) bitcoin is heavily inflationary early on by design\n\nPeople fixate on Bitcoin's price, but there is another more interesting dynamic which is its inflation. If Bitcoin was exactly as it was, but was at best only ever used by ten people how much value could it have? Not much, obviously. Success in Bitcoin isn't obtaining a three or four digit price point, it's obtaining a very broad user base, and doing that requires wide (and perceived to be fair) distribution. That's what keeps the price down. \n\nAt some point, however, things will flip. The units available to the market will not keep pace with the market expanding, possibly (and probably) by orders of magnitude. That's when the price itself will become more spectacular, which will lead to more news and attention, leading to more spectacular pricing still. The thing is, though, this won't happen in a nice orderly predictable manner, as people seem to expect. What I believe will happen, and seems to be happening now, is the market will seek fair value (which I think we're near now) for Bitcoin's price, until the market is compelled to reassess the situation.
