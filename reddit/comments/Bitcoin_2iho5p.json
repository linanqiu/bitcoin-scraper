Unless a company or something wanted to use the Bitcoin network to issue stocks, and that person holding Bitcoin was offered a certain amount of money to be able to have a portion of Bitcoin to divide up into representative shares or something.  Maybe that is where things are heading if this is successful.  People owning parts of a proven, secure block chain that companies want to use for reasons such as this, making it more valuable for these other reasons than as a store of value and/or currency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe this will all coexist down the road like it currently will.  This practice decreases the pool of Bitcoin available to use as a store of value and/or currency, thus increasing individual holder&amp;#39;s value.  But then, who really knows exactly how much Bitcoin is available as a store of value and/or currency to be able to reasonably put a price on it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to just run my mouth here as I think of things.  I&amp;#39;m not trying to necessarily prove a point, but rather throwing these things out there for discussion!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On your decentralized first round of funding you will try to sell the 200k shares on CounterParty, and you will keep a cool 1.8M shares for latter stages, perhaps for your decentralized IPO if this round and other rounds go well.\n\nYou announce your round of funding on date X, and you say you will only be selling 200k shares at $5 a pop, that's the same as BTC 0.01493429 per share. (but you don't mention anywhere the $5 value, you just announce your price in BTC)\n\nSo, you're expecting for people to come and buy the shares from you, there's a lot of news, you're one of the first companies to do this, and as the sell begins, sellers start putting limit orders to sell when the price gets higher, the price of your shares fluctuates IN BITCOIN, if you're lucky, and there's enough volume, you will sell all your offer before the market starts already speculating with the little coins you put in circulation.\n\nEventually people invested BTC 3500 in your company to buy 200k shares, now your company as a whole should be worth about USD $11,718,000.0 in capital, ... what do those 3500 BTC do for bitcoin in itself? I'm not sure, as they will be used by your company, hopefully to not cash out in fiat, but to hire people , equipments, research, PR, and hopefully use the BTC directly to pay people.\n\nOn some days your stock goes down, and with money you've made you decide to buy back some and help keep the price steady,.on others when you think it's over priced, you could get bitcoin liquidity to pay employees or research by selling some of the stock now. All these things would make the market react.\n\nSo looking at this, I believe the value is really held in the crypto shares (not on Bitcoin), and that's where there will be plenty of speculation and money to be made (and lost). My questions is then:\n\nHow can people estimate what the right price in BTC is for the shares of your company? given that BTC is so freaking volatile? can a really bad swing destroy the market cap of your company?\n\nWhat would happen if the USD gained in value to the stock market? Now all of a sudden, a strong USD would mean you'd need less of it to buy the same shares of Google in Wall Street right?",
