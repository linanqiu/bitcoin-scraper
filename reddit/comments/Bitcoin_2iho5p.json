We are really only 2 months since we brought our servers into production for new customers so much of what we're doing still seems amazing to man folks. \n\nAt DigitalTangible we were founded on 3 key principles.\n\n* **We never touch our customer funds:**  All DigitalTangible transactions on our site take place directly between our network of gold dealers or our via P2P trading catalog. The power of Bitcoin allows our customers to conduct direct purchases with our gold dealers and other customers.\n\n* **We never touch our customer's gold:** All our gold is shipped to and stored in a distributed network of bonded, insured depositories. Our customers use their PrivateKeys on their Bitcoin addresses to control the flow and direction of their gold assets. Our customers can verify their gold holdings independently of us and we display all holdings publicly.\n\n* **We are regulatory compliant:** We perform KYC/AML on all purchasing and trading customers in our system so that bad actors cannot attempt to redeem any of our Counterparty gold tokens for physical gold or cash and use our platform as means to subvert the law. Thus, all customers can acquire gold Counterparty tokens on our platform can trade with confidence and security that the system is both transparent and secure. \n\nIt is our objective to change the way any person can acquire real, physical gold for trade, investment, and payments.\n\nAnyone who wishes to email directly with more questions can hit me up at support@digitaltangbiletrust.com and we'd be glad to help answer questions\n",

We are really only 2 months since we brought our servers into production for new customers so much of what we&amp;#39;re doing still seems amazing to man folks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At DigitalTangible we were founded on 3 key principles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We never touch our customer funds:&lt;/strong&gt;  All DigitalTangible transactions on our site take place directly between our network of gold dealers or our via P2P trading catalog. The power of Bitcoin allows our customers to conduct direct purchases with our gold dealers and other customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We never touch our customer&amp;#39;s gold:&lt;/strong&gt; All our gold is shipped to and stored in a distributed network of bonded, insured depositories. Our customers use their PrivateKeys on their Bitcoin addresses to control the flow and direction of their gold assets. Our customers can verify their gold holdings independently of us and we display all holdings publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are regulatory compliant:&lt;/strong&gt; We perform KYC/AML on all purchasing and trading customers in our system so that bad actors cannot attempt to redeem any of our Counterparty gold tokens for physical gold or cash and use our platform as means to subvert the law. Thus, all customers can acquire gold Counterparty tokens on our platform can trade with confidence and security that the system is both transparent and secure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is our objective to change the way any person can acquire real, physical gold for trade, investment, and payments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wishes to email directly with more questions can hit me up at support@digitaltangbiletrust.com and we&amp;#39;d be glad to help answer questions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But this is the way I think it works.\n\nLet's say you have a company and need funding. You decide to fuck VCs, fuck the stock market, and convince the world wide crypto community to fund your company, to invest in your business, now the unbanked will be able to invest and you could have a chance through your passion to get them out of the cycle of poverty.\n\nYou go to CounterParty, and you think your company is currently valued... $10MM, but you want to raise just $1MM to get started, as you don't want to sell your entire company on your first round.. \n\nAt today's price, the $10MM would value your entire company at about BTC 30k (USD 10,044,000 if 1 BTC = $334.80), and let's suppose a lot of people agree with you on that.\n\nThen you say, that the initial price of your shares will be... about $5 each just to pick a cheap number and be more inclusive, the unbanked on the third world could at least buy 1 share from you with the hopes of selling later at a higher price.\n\nYou need to get funds of about just $1MM to get your business going for now, ... and most of all you don't want to give out all your equity.\n\nat $5 per share, that's 200,000 shares for just the $1MM, so for the $10MM (initial full valuation) you'd issue a total of 2,000,000 shares. On your decentralized first round of funding you will try to sell the 200k shares on CounterParty, and you will keep a cool 1.8M shares for latter stages, perhaps for your decentralized IPO if this round and other rounds go well.\n\nYou announce your round of funding on date X, and you say you will only be selling 200k shares at $5 a pop, that's the same as BTC 0.01493429 per share. (but you don't mention anywhere the $5 value, you just announce your price in BTC)\n\nSo, you're expecting for people to come and buy the shares from you, there's a lot of news, you're one of the first companies to do this, and as the sell begins, sellers start putting limit orders to sell when the price gets higher, the price of your shares fluctuates IN BITCOIN, if you're lucky, and there's enough volume, you will sell all your offer before the market starts already speculating with the little coins you put in circulation.\n\nEventually people invested BTC 3500 in your company to buy 200k shares, now your company as a whole should be worth about USD $11,718,000.0 in capital, ... what do those 3500 BTC do for bitcoin in itself? I'm not sure, as they will be used by your company, hopefully to not cash out in fiat, but to hire people , equipments, research, PR, and hopefully use the BTC directly to pay people.\n\nOn some days your stock goes down, and with money you've made you decide to buy back some and help keep the price steady,.on others when you think it's over priced, you could get bitcoin liquidity to pay employees or research by selling some of the stock now. All these things would make the market react.\n\nSo looking at this, I believe the value is really held in the crypto shares (not on Bitcoin), and that's where there will be plenty of speculation and money to be made (and lost). My questions is then:\n\nHow can people estimate what the right price in BTC is for the shares of your company? given that BTC is so freaking volatile? can a really bad swing destroy the market cap of your company?\n\nWhat would happen if the USD gained in value to the stock market? Now all of a sudden, a strong USD would mean you'd need less of it to buy the same shares of Google in Wall Street right?",

Both equities and bonds are required, but bonds are more important than equities for now. Capital markets are also the vital part for mitigating the volatility of bitcoin exchange rate. If bitcoin assets can't provide the little yields as USD does, the cost is too high for people to parking their liquid asset in bitcoin(they have to depend solely on price appreciation, which is unacceptable for most CFOs). Plus interest rates and the yield curve are benchmarks of an economy. That would be an interesting information for this grand bitcoin experiment.",
