Yet policies have been proposed that could lower the total volume of currency transactions, and hence reduce the impact of speculation. One rather radical proposal is to eliminate foreign currency trading by establishing a single currency for several countries\n\nSome regulatory attempts:\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation#Government_responses_and_regulation\n&gt; The economic disadvantages of speculators has resulted in a number of attempts over the years to introduce regulations and restrictions to try and limit or reduce the impact of speculators. Such financial regulation is often enacted in response to a crisis as was the case with the Bubble Act 1720 which was passed by the British government at the height of the South Sea Bubble to try stop speculation in such schemes ...\n\nThere are a couple concepts to understand:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback#In_economics\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory\n\nHere is a question: Could we self-regulate the exchange markets?\n\nLet's suppose each of the major exchanges voluntarily implements a system that prevents wide swings in market price - and there are fairly easy ways of doing that. A \"throttling\" mechanism for traders can slow down what could potentially be a big spike. Would there be enough agreement between the large exchanges to implement it? The smaller exchanges may not, but since the volume there is small anyways, they may not impact the volatility.\n\nSecond question: Could we design a mechanism directly into the Bitcoin protocol that could help prevent rapid speculative bubbles? Since speculation is a function of fiat currency (or quite frankly, anything acting as a base of value), perhaps not.\n\nFrom my perspective, speculation is equivalent of email spam. It's more of an attack on Bitcoin than a function of it. There are heuristic mechanisms to help prevent spam, various detection methods.\n\nHow could we prevent Bitcoin spam? We need to be able to differentiate between valid exchange and speculative exchange, just like separating real email from spam email.\n\nBut the ultimate gatekeeper here are the exchanges.\n\nThere have been discussions about distributed exchanges or decentralized exchanges. And perhaps in such a system, we could have a bit more control over tracking and throttling exchange - but it seems unlikely.\n\nIt's a tough problem, but I think worth solving if we do want Bitcoin to be stable and used as a currency, store of value, and unit of account.\n\nEdit: Another idea that came to my mind is as follows.\n\nPrice stabilization pools.\n\nImagine an exchange such as Bitstamp introducing a single price stabilization pool in which users can join. This is a special pool of funds dedicated to price stabilization. Users who are Bitcoin advocates and desire price stability can voluntarily enter this pool with some amount of money, which collectively, can provide a large amount of weight. \n\nNow, when there is a price move, the exchange automatically puts in the reverse order from the pool account that counters the move. This effectively returns the price to what it was before automatically.\n\nIn order to work properly against normal growth and corrections, the pool will operate on a formula that calculates volume, typical order sizes, as well as a normalized \"pool vote\" of how much movement is acceptable. Also, there would be a cutoff if a pattern is appearing that cannot be controlled by the pool. This is to protect the pool from a major shift in valuation (such as large players attempting to move the markets).\n\nIf this pool is large enough that collectively it easily encompasses the size of even the largest typical traders easily, perhaps it can act to help stabilize the volatility. Imagine a $200m stabilization pool of 200,000 users who each put in an average of $1,000. Now, a large $10m player can try to swing the market, but the stabilization pool would activate and act against it. It sort of \"locks-in\" the price. \n\nMaybe this is just crazy thinking, but I'm just brainstorming on the fly.",
