Manbearwhale has 26000 BTC to sell, and they've shown no signs of slowing down. Clearly someone is sending the price down intentionally, and unless another, larger bull whale comes along and shits in this guy's Cheerios, he's sending us past the previous ATH and wiping out the remaining morons who're trading on margin. Why would they stop now when they can show that adage of past performance and future results in action? Mind you, I haven't sold any BTC, either. The fundamentals have only improved throughout this downtrend, I'm in this for the long term, and I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose.",
