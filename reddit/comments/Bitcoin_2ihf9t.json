There are \"zero knowledge\" systems that can do things differently SRP from Stanford is one and it is supposedly built into the recent versions of openssl but idk if anyone uses it yet. There were some patent questions that de-railed it after it first came out, afaicr.        \n     \n\n&gt; Like a signature to a Bitcoin node that confirms that I signed it,..
