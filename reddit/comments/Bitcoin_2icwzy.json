In fact, the market holds the peg and has done a steady job of this since BitShares X began floating the BitAssets. BitUSD has tracked the underlying commodity market very faithfully, just at a discount due to its limited utility thusfar. The price feeds are a minor tweak to allow the system to work well with limited market depth. In a very short time, those tweaks will be irrelevant, as this system is set to debut in earnest. Bear in mind, everything we've seen so far has been beta testing. With greater volume, the market in BitShares X will set everything. ",

In fact, the market holds the peg and has done a steady job of this since BitShares X began floating the BitAssets. BitUSD has tracked the underlying commodity market very faithfully, just at a discount due to its limited utility thusfar. The price feeds are a minor tweak to allow the system to work well with limited market depth. In a very short time, those tweaks will be irrelevant, as this system is set to debut in earnest. Bear in mind, everything we&amp;#39;ve seen so far has been beta testing. With greater volume, the market in BitShares X will set everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Online shopping is not being revolutionized by bitcoin, it's just another payment option that is (arguably, which I would) inferior to credit cards.  The only real use for bitcoin has been between two non-business entities. Its great for people that already have bitcoin and want to give money to other people that already have bitcoin, but have no store set up. But even then, you already have things like paypal for that.\n\nBitcoin is nowhere near as revolutionary as the internet was. Shit, just having aol instant messenger was way more valuable than having bitcoin is. If you want to compare bitcoin to something, maybe compare it to amazons one click? It's just another payment option, but with huge externalities involved and security left to the user instead of a third party. ",

Literally every merchant just receives bit coins and immediately converts to fiat. Online shopping is not being revolutionized by bitcoin, it&amp;#39;s just another payment option that is (arguably, which I would) inferior to credit cards.  The only real use for bitcoin has been between two non-business entities. Its great for people that already have bitcoin and want to give money to other people that already have bitcoin, but have no store set up. But even then, you already have things like paypal for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is nowhere near as revolutionary as the internet was. Shit, just having aol instant messenger was way more valuable than having bitcoin is. If you want to compare bitcoin to something, maybe compare it to amazons one click? It&amp;#39;s just another payment option, but with huge externalities involved and security left to the user instead of a third party. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Why adopt the new technology?  For the fees paid to markets for each transaction (low as 2% and high as 8%) several things are offered such as simple organization of orders, server side encryption (frowned upon but sometimes needed for the less inclined buyers), a moderator in disputes that is familiar with scams and scenarios that might arise from these type of transactions and so forth. \n\nAdoption of new technology by vendors and buyers will only happen if it provides a simple interface AND benefits over current technology.

Multi-Sig has been available on several of the major markets now for a while and very few vendors choose to utilize it even though several have lost quite a bit due to market failure (scam, hack, or seizure). Why adopt the new technology?  For the fees paid to markets for each transaction (low as 2% and high as 8%) several things are offered such as simple organization of orders, server side encryption (frowned upon but sometimes needed for the less inclined buyers), a moderator in disputes that is familiar with scams and scenarios that might arise from these type of transactions and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adoption of new technology by vendors and buyers will only happen if it provides a simple interface AND benefits over current technology. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
