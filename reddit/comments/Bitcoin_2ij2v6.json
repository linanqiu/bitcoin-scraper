They’re all trying to figure it out. The technology folks who work for the banks are very smart, and the trading floors have split between ‘This is for real’ and ‘This is a joke.’ Yet people are leaving those institutions to start bitcoin companies. We’re seeing hundreds of bitcoin entrepreneurs. Some of them are brand new to financial services. They don’t know what they’re in for, but they’re excited.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;‘‘If you’re used to living in a world where you trust people and institutions, then it probably does seem weird and bizarre that you would trust something where you don’t know who created it. But if you’re in a world where you trust numbers and math and code, it doesn’t matter. There is no appeal to authority. You evaluate it on the basis of the math. It’s just math; it’s completely open.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
