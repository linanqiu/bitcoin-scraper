He said it dropped down from about 90% so the trend is to actually use it. But still he thinks that it is way too risky for people because the price can go down by a lot in a short timeframe. He thinks the future is problematic. How can people gain trust in a currency that fluctuates that much? Then he talks about how in 3+ years the Euro or Dollar might just adapt and then there might just be a electronic crypto dollar/euro \"beating bitcoin with its own weapon\".\n\nIn the end the video talks about how bitcoin is popular amongst liberals and mavericks(?).

It sounded very positive and didn't come off as something negative.\n\nOverall a pretty good video.",
