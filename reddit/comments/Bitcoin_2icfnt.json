That is a way of use much more understandable and palatable to the average member of the public.\n\nAgreed. There just needs to be demonstrable proof that the private keys are protected, and I'm not sure that's possible.\n\n&gt;I agree they are less than ideal though. Even if the private key were secured inside the card somehow, you can never be 100% certain that whoever made the card isn't going to empty the address without notice...
