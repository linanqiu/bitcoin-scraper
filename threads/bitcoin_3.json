          "selftext": "There are hardly any funds towards advertisement if any regarding bitcoin. Normally when a business creates an idea thousands of dollars are spent towards advertising but bitcoin isn't owned by a business. Satoshi put in zero dollars towards advertisement.  \n  \nNot saying that any of you should spend a cent but if you're interested in the documentary on bitcoin consider buying it rather than getting it by other means such as pirate bay. I'm pre-ordering at the moment. There may be better ways to do this rather than the documentary so feel free to share.  \nThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin - http://bitcoindoc.com/",

          "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm glad I learn't about Bitcoin early this year... I must say that I learnt more than Bitcoin in the process. I'm fascinated with this technology.\n\nI have convinced some people to learn Bitcoin (and own one) and also highlighted the huge risks involved. \n\nI had a few BTCs and other cryptos until yesterday, I sold all of it. I do not hold a lot of BTC as I only hold what I can afford. I'm moving on... indefinitely...\n\nI would have hold my btc/cryptos longer, but I cannot accept that someone can just put a huge wall in the bitcoin market in other words manipulate the market in your face, and you cannot do anything about. It was irresponsible act. \n\nAgain, I say to late adaptors, please own what you can afford to loose. Don't push it too hard. This world this for wealthy people, early adopters, genius and \"crazy\".\n\nFor now, I'm not going to buy any cryptos until such time its mature, regulations are place and cheap... In my case, sending money overseas using crypto is expensive than western union + price fluctuates wildly and few people manipulate the price. However, It's a great protocol, but I wish we can make it more energy efficient, add flexible anonymity features, faster (not &gt;30 minutes for 6 confirmations).\n\n\"I'll be BACK\"... let the cowboys rule this space in the meantime, hopefully not for long... \n",
