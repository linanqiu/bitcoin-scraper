Bob love paying Bitcoins for companies he trust (and Bob wants his product to be shipped immediately almost the next second) But Bob doesn&amp;#39;t like waiting 1-2 Bitcoin confirmations. He has 1 BTC in insurance reserve. Bob can withdraw his BTC only in a specified time window. Once Bob set his insurance reserve, he can forget about it.\nUnconfirmed transactions in Bitcoin arrive to your merchant approximately in 20 seconds, while waiting for Bitcoin Network confirmation usually takes from ~~10 to ~~40 minutes Next time he goes shopping for products with immediate shipping, he just easily pays his 1 BTC to anyone who support immediate payments feature. And once he&amp;#39;s done his payment merchant gets his unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction, next step for merchant is getting that callback URL from insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case if Bob making a double-spending, the system recognizes that &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;reserves his 1 BTC&lt;/strong&gt; to cover double-spend expense When Bob will make a payment from his wallet, his wallet notifies &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; about his original sender to reserve that 1 BTC. Once that 1 BTC is reserved, &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; will send only 1 callback to 1 chosen company. If Bob will send different transactions with the same Bitcoins to the other companies, these companies will receive unconfirmed transactions in their address without knowing that it is a double-spending, but this companies won&amp;#39;t authorize transaction, because these companies won&amp;#39;t receive callback from the service\nIf no one offered this before I will be highly surprised. But anyway I want to raise this topic, because very often I&amp;#39;m inventing the wheels, or maybe today its different? Maybe you would improve something?

We really need a noob friendly wallet.  &amp;quot;Noob friendly&amp;quot; not as in &amp;quot;show you the ropes&amp;quot;, but as in &amp;#39;nobody has to spend time to learn to use it PERIOD&amp;quot;.  I really like HIVE wallet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd.  How do we promote a Bitcoin economy?  Right now one problem we have is merchants accepting Bitcoin, but dumping it in exchange for fiat.  So using Bitcoin is essentially selling it.  Its making Bitcoin an unwanted resource in a fiat economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Merchant adoption is a step, but keeping a &amp;quot;Bitcoin cycle&amp;quot; is the real goal we should be working towards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd.  Lets not let &lt;a href=\"/r/dogecoin\"&gt;/r/dogecoin&lt;/a&gt; do all the PR work.  What about really gathering the Bitcoin community to solve something big.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bitcoin can do this.  Bitcoin can do that&amp;quot;  ...yeah.

          "selftext": "Hi /r/bitcoin.\n\nInstead of talking about price and value and what not.\n\nLets brainstorm some ideas on improving Bitcoin and the community.\n\nFor one, I think we have a long way to go. \n\n1st.  We really need a noob friendly wallet.  \"Noob friendly\" not as in \"show you the ropes\", but as in 'nobody has to spend time to learn to use it PERIOD\".  I really like HIVE wallet.\n\n\n\n2nd.  How do we promote a Bitcoin economy?  Right now one problem we have is merchants accepting Bitcoin, but dumping it in exchange for fiat.  So using Bitcoin is essentially selling it.  Its making Bitcoin an unwanted resource in a fiat economy.\n\nMerchant adoption is a step, but keeping a \"Bitcoin cycle\" is the real goal we should be working towards.\n\n\n3rd.  Lets not let /r/dogecoin do all the PR work.  What about really gathering the Bitcoin community to solve something big.\n\n\"Bitcoin can do this.  Bitcoin can do that\"  ...yeah.

It's an alternate to the current paradigm. Think of how many happy people, will spend their money, if you knew it'd make them rich. We could end world hunger. We could be better and better everyday. It's okay to make mistakes. Learn that's what they are, and continue to love yourself. We're hardest on ourselves, and not in the \"We're hardest on ourselves, we say \"we're hardest on ourselves\", just to say \"we're hardest on ourselves\". We represent an emerging paradigm. One of love. Remember to love.",
