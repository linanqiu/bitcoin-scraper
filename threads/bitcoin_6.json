As the market continues to fall and the year is closing out, this will be the worst year ever. Even if the slow steady slide fianlly stops, the price of bitcoin will probably still have a loss of over 60% since it&amp;#39;s all time high last November.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad news makes Bitcoin drop. Good news makes it drop too. That means that there are people waiting to exit. They want out. Big whales from the early days are cashing out. Little fish that can&amp;#39;t survive without an occasional sale are being forced to sell. Longs are going bust. And the people at Buttcoin? Guess what...they are throwing huge parties from all the money they made shorting cryptos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The newest TA lines show the price dropping to near $260. The $233 mark will probably get tested. Blood is everywhere. Some of it is yours. On a personal level, many of us are out on a limb. We believed in Bitcoin so strongly that we invested all our spare cash. We sold stock &amp;amp; precious metals and invested in BTC. We put off car repairs. We refused to spend money on luxuries. We avoided paying bills every time that BTC dropped and grabbed a bit more. We had faith. We HODL. Every drop in price was another grab. When the price went to $600, it was &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot;, BTC on sale. When it went to $500, it was &amp;quot;double wow&amp;quot;, BTC on big sale. When the price dropped to $400, it was &amp;quot;triple wow, super sale&amp;quot;. But we started to worry, we were out of money. Now we are down to almost $300 and it is &amp;quot;shit, I should buy more, but there is no money left&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. Fundamentals are great. There is good news everywhere. Circle is working. Payment providers are starting to accept Bitcoin. Newegg takes BTC, you can buy plane tickets with BTC, even PayPal is starting to integrate BTC. Yet the price keeps dropping like a rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened. There are two fundamentals working against Bitcoin right now. The first is mining. In the past, most miners were just computer nerds, they had other jobs and held onto most of their coins. They didn&amp;#39;t need to sell. It was an experiment for them. Half of them didn&amp;#39;t even think the concept would work, but it was fun to play with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now mining is done at huge farms. These places have to sell most of their bitcoins. Many are operating at a loss and have to sell all they get. Close to 3600 coins a day are being dumped on the market. The second thing is legacy mining. A lot of people from the old days have huge stockpiles of BTC. They retired. Now they slowly sell them off to pay living expenses. If the price drops in half, no problem, they just sell twice as many, they have thousands, maybe millions left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study previous bubbles. After a bubble, the market tends to form a bowl shaped pattern before the next big jump up in price. There is an all time high of about $1163 on Nov 29, 2013. Now we have a new sustained low of just over $300 on Oct 4, 2014. This is over 10 months. To complete the bowl shape will take at least another 10 months. Then there will be a short flag shape event with high volume as people that bought way back get out. They are just trying to recover their investment. Only after that will there be strong sustained growth (maybe even a new bubble). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you are waiting at least 10 months. That is a 50% probability. A 25% probability that it could be shorter (unexpected whale buying) and a 25% probability (more whales selling) that you will be waiting till 2016. That means a 75% probability that BTC price wont reach $1000 again till near the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we know that Bitcoin makes a lot of stuff obsolete as a store of value. Gold, Art, Land, Offshore Tax Havens. These are all obsolete. Super rich people (the 1%) don&amp;#39;t care though. They control the government. Fiat serves them nicely. They don&amp;#39;t want to support Bitcoin. They support the old system. They will avoid Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for the 99% (us) and we are mostly broke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does this all mean for you as an individual? If you are checking prices every day, you are probably in a state of deep depression. Your wife is telling you to cut your losses and sell. Your mom is hinting that you should attend Gambler&amp;#39;s Anonymous. You dad is disappointed in you. Your friends avoid you. Your kids are asking for their allowance. People call late at night. You have nightmares of Jesse from Breaking Bad busting down your door, holding a gun to your face and saying &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s my money...BIIIITCH&amp;quot;. Suicide hotline numbers are being posted \neverywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do you still have faith? Do you still believe in Bitcoin? If so, it is time for a vacation. Get away from it all. Create a brainwallet, send all your coins there. Get a backpack, collect your toothbrush and some comfortable clothes. Leave a note on the table: &amp;quot;See you in summer of 2016&amp;quot;. Take off. Go hitch-hiking. Live on the beach. Check out the soup kitchens. Go south to warmer weather. If you got the resources, go to Hawaii, it is the best state to be homeless. Why summer of 2016? Bitcoin should recover by then. 90% chance of being over $1200, with a 50% chance of hitting $2000 or higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t check the Bitcoin price till then. Make yourself wait. Read books &amp;amp; magazines at the library, but don&amp;#39;t go online. Don&amp;#39;t even touch a computer, you will be tempted to check, discover the price is still down, and go back to being depressed. You have to go cold turkey. No price checking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do this? Here is the problem with waiting. Half of the stress and anxiety is from all the people that expect you to support them or to pay your bills. They nag and harass you, which causes stress. You are overextend, bitcoin prices are abysmal. You could sell them now and get some relief. But guess what, in a few years bitcoin will recover, but you won&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I know this? Several decades ago, I bought $2000 worth of Microsoft shortly after they went public. That stock is worth over a million dollars now. Do I still have it? No, I sold it to pay rent when it was still worth $2000 (I was unemployed for six months). I supported my family. BTW, that wife abandoned me several years later. I should have just left them and been homeless for a few years. Then I would be a millionaire. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will your family leave you? I don&amp;#39;t know. If they do, you can get another one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to be rich, you have to make it your #1 priority. There is no other way. Most people only get one chance per lifetime. Many don&amp;#39;t even get that. This is your chance. Don&amp;#39;t blow it.  Keep HODLing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Many, including so-called experts in other fields, miss this. Yes, Bitcoin enthusiasts have already pointed out all the infrastructure and investment pouring into Bitcoin as something else warranting consideration. I agree, but that&amp;#39;s maybe not so easy for people to measure as a metric form, so I&amp;#39;ll offer another, along with an explanation which can show many of the less insightful why Bitcoin enthusiasts have such unwavering confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin isn&amp;#39;t a stock or Ponzi. Valuing it similarly, based on price point alone, therefore is likely to result in mistakes. Things like stocks or Ponzi item inventories are traded in a market and derive a price, but unlike Bitcoin the total units available to the market is basically fixed. People trade a relatively static supply of these and it&amp;#39;s up to new entrants to enter the market along with other dynamics like sentiment to result in price increases. Bitcoin, however, doesn&amp;#39;t have a static supply for the market. By design the units available are inflationary, because Bitcoin is a &lt;em&gt;currency&lt;/em&gt;. What makes a currency valuable is how many people use it, not what the sentiment on it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a better way to gauge how well Bitcoin is doing is to &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt; the number of currency units in any analysis. Doing that paints a very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using these two sources I derive some interesting numbers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=1year&amp;amp;showDataPoints=true&amp;amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;amp;show_header=true&amp;amp;scale=0&amp;amp;address=\"&gt;https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=1year&amp;amp;showDataPoints=true&amp;amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;amp;show_header=true&amp;amp;scale=0&amp;amp;address=&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv\"&gt;http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following shows Bitcoin price points multiplied by total coins in existence at 1 year intervals, to find a &lt;em&gt;total market cap&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$12 * 10,091,000 =  121 million.....Oct &amp;#39;12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$120 * 11,790,000 = 1.4 billion.....Oct &amp;#39;13  (1057% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$350 * 13,341,000 = 4.66 billion....Oct &amp;#39;14  (232% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$? * 14,650,000 = 6.99 billion........Oct &amp;#39;15  (50% increase)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see the &lt;em&gt;market cap&lt;/em&gt; of Bitcoin is doing extremely well. Wall St. traders would love such yearly increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice for Oct &amp;#39;15 I project a 50% increase. Why? It&amp;#39;s because I expect the trend to be up, but as many may have heard by now it&amp;#39;s generally expected for Bitcoin&amp;#39;s volatility to lessen as time goes on and the market grows larger (making it more useful as a currency). The numbers above show that - the market is finding equlibrium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given this we can solve for and predict what Bitcoin&amp;#39;s price should be in Oct &amp;#39;15, which in this case is $477.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. I rarely make speculative predictions, but this is mine for the next year. If you bought in over $500 my advice is to hold. I think there is a good chance you&amp;#39;ll recover your money after a year. If you&amp;#39;re looking to get into Bitcoin my advice is to buy, and there is a good chance you&amp;#39;ll make at least 50% on your money in 1 year (not bad by Wall St. standards).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But.. but... but I thought I was going to be RICH!?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, you may be. I depends how many bitcoins you have. Indeed, Bitcoin has already made many of its users rich. That story may not be over either. Why? Well for that we need a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; kind of chart:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://blog.betable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle-1.png\"&gt;http://blog.betable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle-1.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what&amp;#39;s known as a technology adoption curve. It&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve seen happen over and over again with different technologies, other than Bitcoin. This shows all the fantastic growth we&amp;#39;ve seen in Bitcoin, all the 3,000% increases, news, attention etc. is only a precursor of what&amp;#39;s to come, because we&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; in the early adopter stage. If you don&amp;#39;t think so ask your local grocer if they own any bitcoins, or even if any of their friends do. Until that answer is yes, we&amp;#39;re not out of the early adopter stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is something else, though. That&amp;#39;s a chart specifically for &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt;. Bitcoin isn&amp;#39;t only a new technology. It&amp;#39;s a new &lt;em&gt;currency&lt;/em&gt; - a global one. We simply don&amp;#39;t have any good charts or data on what happens when the global population begins to adopt the same new currency. The closest thing to that would be the US dollar, the world&amp;#39;s reserve currency, and obviously that&amp;#39;s something measured in the trillions, not the millions or billions Bitcoin markets are measured in now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the 477 price target is only based on the market trying to find equilibrium with what Bitcoin is today, not what it becomes in the future, which can look very different than what it is today. Markets seek equilibrium. That&amp;#39;s what they do. So don&amp;#39;t despair about day to day price point gains or losses. In the grand scheme of things Bitcoin is right on target.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I agree, but that's maybe not so easy for people to measure as a metric form, so I'll offer another, along with an explanation which can show many of the less insightful why Bitcoin enthusiasts have such unwavering confidence.\n\nBitcoin isn't a stock or Ponzi. Valuing it similarly, based on price point alone, therefore is likely to result in mistakes. Things like stocks or Ponzi item inventories are traded in a market and derive a price, but unlike Bitcoin the total units available to the market is basically fixed. People trade a relatively static supply of these and it's up to new entrants to enter the market along with other dynamics like sentiment to result in price increases. Bitcoin, however, doesn't have a static supply for the market. By design the units available are inflationary, because Bitcoin is a *currency*. What makes a currency valuable is how many people use it, not what the sentiment on it is.\n\nSo, a better way to gauge how well Bitcoin is doing is to *include* the number of currency units in any analysis. Doing that paints a very different picture.\n\nUsing these two sources I derive some interesting numbers:\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins?timespan=1year&amp;showDataPoints=true&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=\n\nhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv\n\nThe following shows Bitcoin price points multiplied by total coins in existence at 1 year intervals, to find a *total market cap*.\n\n$12 * 10,091,000 =  121 million.....Oct '12\n\n$120 * 11,790,000 = 1.4 billion.....Oct '13  (1057% increase)\n\n$350 * 13,341,000 = 4.66 billion....Oct '14  (232% increase)\n\n$? * 14,650,000 = 6.99 billion........Oct '15  (50% increase)\n\nAs you can see the *market cap* of Bitcoin is doing extremely well. Wall St. traders would love such yearly increases.\n\nNotice for Oct '15 I project a 50% increase. Why? It's because I expect the trend to be up, but as many may have heard by now it's generally expected for Bitcoin's volatility to lessen as time goes on and the market grows larger (making it more useful as a currency). The numbers above show that - the market is finding equlibrium.\n\nGiven this we can solve for and predict what Bitcoin's price should be in Oct '15, which in this case is $477.\n\nSo there you have it. I rarely make speculative predictions, but this is mine for the next year. If you bought in over $500 my advice is to hold. I think there is a good chance you'll recover your money after a year. If you're looking to get into Bitcoin my advice is to buy, and there is a good chance you'll make at least 50% on your money in 1 year (not bad by Wall St. standards).\n\nBut.. but... but I thought I was going to be RICH!?!\n\nWell, you may be. I depends how many bitcoins you have. Indeed, Bitcoin has already made many of its users rich. That story may not be over either. Why? Well for that we need a *different* kind of chart:\n\nhttp://blog.betable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Technology-Adoption-Lifecycle-1.png\n\nThis is what's known as a technology adoption curve. It's what we've seen happen over and over again with different technologies, other than Bitcoin. This shows all the fantastic growth we've seen in Bitcoin, all the 3,000% increases, news, attention etc. is only a precursor of what's to come, because we're *still* in the early adopter stage. If you don't think so ask your local grocer if they own any bitcoins, or even if any of their friends do. Until that answer is yes, we're not out of the early adopter stage.\n\nThere is something else, though. That's a chart specifically for *technology*. Bitcoin isn't only a new technology. It's a new *currency* - a global one. We simply don't have any good charts or data on what happens when the global population begins to adopt the same new currency. The closest thing to that would be the US dollar, the world's reserve currency, and obviously that's something measured in the trillions, not the millions or billions Bitcoin markets are measured in now.\n\nSo the 477 price target is only based on the market trying to find equilibrium with what Bitcoin is today, not what it becomes in the future, which can look very different than what it is today. Markets seek equilibrium. That's what they do. So don't despair about day to day price point gains or losses. In the grand scheme of things Bitcoin is right on target.",

I&amp;#39;m in a pretty bad situation and I need some advice on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I became in charge of my family&amp;#39;s finances. One of my parents passed much earlier than expected. My remaining parent didn&amp;#39;t understand anything about finance or investing so I naturally stepped in to take over things and try to plan something for our family so that we could be financially secure for at least 10 or 15 years, enough time for me to get to a position in my career where I could take care of everyone with my own income stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started learning about trading, first with Forex. I was trading EURUSD and USDJPY primarily just with small amounts at first. Spent a lot of time on babypips.com learning technical analysis and how to extract as much value as possible from chart patterns. When I started I just used small amounts of money. My initial bankroll was $500. I ended up using too much leverage and blowing through my whole account because of some poorly time trades. Yes I know I should have used some common sense and not taken gigantic risks but I was just learning at the time. I worked at it a bit and started getting profitable. I would usually do my work late at night watching charts and drinking espressos, and there were several times that I took positions that netted me large profits so I&amp;#39;m confident that I&amp;#39;ve learned from my early mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about a year and a half ago I started hearing about bitcoin, and how it was getting more valuable. I started reading about the blockchain, and this technology that is going to revolutionize the way the world thinks about money. I was excited about it, truly. I knew in my heart that this was going to be gigantic. So I took a leap. I took about half of all the cash I had in my checking account and deposited it at Mt.Gox. I didn&amp;#39;t use any of the inheritance money, just my own from my part time job while I was a college student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I know. Terrible idea in hindsight. I never got the money out before the whole thing collapsed. I wish I hadn&amp;#39;t done it, but at the same time it wasn&amp;#39;t a great deal of money to learn a lesson. That we can&amp;#39;t just trust individual exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I learned a lot during that experience. I spent a lot of time analyzing charts. I learned how to use MACD and RSI indicators. I started getting good at being able to time things and on paper (of course) I was making very good profits. It&amp;#39;s a shame that I didn&amp;#39;t cash out before the whole thing went to shit because I probably would have enough money to last atleast a few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after Gox, I became really depressed but I still believed in bitcoin. I still thought it was going to be around for a very long time so I started looking for some more honest exchanges. I knew that what happened to me was just an unfortunate event that was unlikely to happen again. After all, Gox was being run by a pretty shady group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I picked myself back up, I decided to deposit some of the inheritance money in some legitimate exchanges. In total we had about $300k after medical bills and other issues from the settlement of the estate. It was sitting in a checking account until about April of this year. I decided to put in $50k into two exchanges to diversify my risk exposure. Half I put into bitfinex and the other half I put into bitstamp. I spent 7 to 10 hours a day trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I&amp;#39;ve been taking mostly long positions. Every time the price drops 30 to 40 dollars I have been telling myself &lt;strong&gt;this is it&lt;/strong&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;this is the bottom&lt;/strong&gt; and will take a position to make up for previous losses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot understand why this is happening. I made some serious money several times but for the past 6 months or so I have taken huge losses. After the initial 50k I deposited another 50k, and then after losing much of that, and determining (wrongly, I might add, but I don&amp;#39;t think my analysis was wrong) that we were definitely at the bottom, I went on to deposit another 125k. So far I am down a lot. My average cost per bitcoin is around $623.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The losses just keep compounding. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;m getting incredibly desperate and sallow. I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m going to explain this to my family. They know very little about bitcoin, but I have mentioned it on occasion and how I&amp;#39;m an enthusiast. I&amp;#39;ve even sent my sister and cousins some bitcoin to get them started. But now I&amp;#39;m worried that maybe this isn&amp;#39;t going to work out. Every day I get out of bed and dread looking at the price of bitcoin. Because I know its going to translate into losses on the positions I&amp;#39;ve taken. I have tried really hard to avoid looking at the price but at this point I cannot take it any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just looking for a reason, any reason, to believe that things are going to get better. So far I&amp;#39;ve lost a lot of the estate money and I&amp;#39;ll do anything to get it back. But I&amp;#39;m getting to the point where I feel like I might need to get to grips with reality and just cut my losses, admit to my family what I did and try to make it up to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I ask of you, please convince me one way or another (with some solid reasoning) to either sell all the coins I have on margin right now or just hold fast and weather this storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I decided to put in $50k into two exchanges to diversify my risk exposure. Half I put into bitfinex and the other half I put into bitstamp. I spent 7 to 10 hours a day trading.\n\nThe problem is that I've been taking mostly long positions. Every time the price drops 30 to 40 dollars I have been telling myself **this is it** -- **this is the bottom** and will take a position to make up for previous losses.\n\nI cannot understand why this is happening. I made some serious money several times but for the past 6 months or so I have taken huge losses. After the initial 50k I deposited another 50k, and then after losing much of that, and determining (wrongly, I might add, but I don't think my analysis was wrong) that we were definitely at the bottom, I went on to deposit another 125k. So far I am down a lot. My average cost per bitcoin is around $623.\n\nThe losses just keep compounding. I don't know what to do. I'm getting incredibly desperate and sallow. I don't know how I'm going to explain this to my family. They know very little about bitcoin, but I have mentioned it on occasion and how I'm an enthusiast. I've even sent my sister and cousins some bitcoin to get them started. But now I'm worried that maybe this isn't going to work out. Every day I get out of bed and dread looking at the price of bitcoin. Because I know its going to translate into losses on the positions I've taken. I have tried really hard to avoid looking at the price but at this point I cannot take it any more.\n\nI'm just looking for a reason, any reason, to believe that things are going to get better. So far I've lost a lot of the estate money and I'll do anything to get it back. But I'm getting to the point where I feel like I might need to get to grips with reality and just cut my losses, admit to my family what I did and try to make it up to them.\n\nSo I ask of you, please convince me one way or another (with some solid reasoning) to either sell all the coins I have on margin right now or just hold fast and weather this storm.\n\nThanks",
