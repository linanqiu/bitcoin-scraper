I am interested to know if anything like this has been proposed before, I think it would have major advantages for the adoption of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was initially trying to think of how to solve the problem of needing to move coins when the private key wasn&amp;#39;t available, such as if someone lost them, or even if the owner died, although that in itself isn&amp;#39;t a widespread problem, I think that what I came up with has larger benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the solution is not going to allow arbitrary raids on other peoples Bitcoin addresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution is for the person who owns the wallet to generate additional secondary keys, either when the wallet is first created or at any time later. These secondary keys are distinct from the primary key that controls the wallet and can safely be given to people you might (or might not) trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like regular keys the secondary keys could be used to sign a transaction and move coins on behalf of the address. However, the transactions signed by these keys would be distinct, and nodes would recognize that the transaction has been signed by a secondary key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When such a transaction was relayed it would be written into the blockchain like normal, however, like newly mined coins, the output coins from the transaction would not be spendable for a significant number of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this stage a few things could have happened:-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The genuine owner of the wallet lost their private keys. They went to their trusted friend and told them about the loss, the friend helped them recover their funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The genuine owner of the wallet died. The coins were moved by a relative or solicitor who had been trusted with a secondary key. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Someone who had been trusted with the key went rogue and decided to steal the coins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the new transaction is initially recorded in the blockchain it will be publicly visible. At this point, if the person who owns the wallet is still around then they should be able to get an alert, triggered by the visibility of the new transaction on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the owner did not want the transaction to go through, then they could sign a different transaction with their own primary key to move the coins to a new wallet, or write a command to the blockchain to cancel the original transaction and render the outputs from the transaction that was signed by the secondary key to &amp;#39;permanently immature&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;dead&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the owner of the wallet wanted the transaction to happen then they would just do nothing. Eventually the coins moved by the secondary keys would mature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the coins were moved by a primary key before they had matured from being moved by the secondary key, then the Bitcoin system would have to realize this and not allow the coins moved by the secondary key to mature, ever. Clearly this requires big changes to existing software and would increase &amp;#39;spam&amp;#39; on the blockchain as all failed transactions would be recorded permanently on the blockchain, it would be appropriate for someone using a secondary key to pay a miners fee from their own wallet that would mature regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would all allow a user to generate additional keys to give out to friends who might be able to help in case of difficulty or to family, solicitors, etc. And not have to worry that they could run off with all their coins. An additional feature could be added that would encode other information into the keys other than that they were primary or secondary. Perhaps the key is only allowed to send a certain volume of transactions or the time it takes for the outputs to mature varies by key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this was developed then it could also fix a criticism about Bitcoin that I quite frequently see, that it does not have a feature like direct debits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For many of us, the fact that another organisation cannot simply dip into our wallets and take our money is a huge bonus that Bitcoin offers over traditional banking systems. It can not be denied however that this does lead to an increased inconvenience when trying to use Bitcoin for every day life and a reluctance of organisations like utility companies to accept Bitcoin. A secondary key as described could be issued for a wallet and be given to another entity such as an energy or water supplier, as long as the owner of the wallet was reasonably pro-active in watching out for payment alerts, then there is no risk of the utility company running away with the funds. I am thinking that a typical &amp;#39;maturing time&amp;#39; specified for a secondary key that was given to the water company would be something like 14 31 days, if Bitcoin were to be used as a daily fact of life then we might assume that people would have ample opportunity to spot the cancellable payments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to somehow being encoded in the key, the info about the limits of the new key could be written into the blockchain at the time the key is created, probably a miners fee would have to be paid. When the key was used nodes would check that it was acting within its limits in terms of potentially many variables: Date ranges the key is valid for, transaction limits, frequency limits and receiver address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a big advantage to Bitcoin if it allowed for direct-debit like features and I could see a lot more organisations and major companies accepting it as a valid payment method. Utility companies would be able to be fairly sure that the person was &amp;#39;good&amp;#39; for the money even if they might yet cancel it, and would continue to provide service in faith that the transaction would eventually mature. This is pretty much what happens anyway as most banks will allow for the reversal of a direct debit by the sending account holder and as such if this feature was implemented in Bitcoin then it would sit fairly well with existing processes. People would not worry about having to pay their bills while they were on holiday and companies would get their regular payments without needing to get an account holder to actively do anything (traditionally very difficult) as long as the sender still had the funds. Has anything like this been proposed before? Please can I have some feedback on this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
