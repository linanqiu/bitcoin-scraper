You continue to hold your 5 BTC valued at $1875 total. Of course you could sell them later, but if you do you won't realize the tax advantages until at least 2016 and the tax benefits may be reduced.\n2. you sell. Now you have $1875 in USD and an extra $750 coming from the IRS as early as February 2015.\n\nWhich scenario sounds better to you?",
