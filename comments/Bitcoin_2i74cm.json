It's HD! Please help testing so we can release it the next days.\n&gt;\n&gt;For the mainnet version, you need to become tester (see [https://plus.google.com/101256420499771441772/posts/VhyWchXkBFR](https://plus.google.com/101256420499771441772/posts/VhyWchXkBFR)). The testnet version is on Google Play already for everyone. There is also direct downloads here: [https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/releases/tag/v4.0](https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/releases/tag/v4.0)\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is what's new in v4.0:\n&gt;\n&gt;* All Bitcoin addresses are now deterministically derived from one single secret, which was created when you installed the app for the first time. So from now on, only one backup is needed to recover all your future funds in that wallet.\n&gt;\n&gt;* The app does its best to not reuse addresses any more. \"Request coins\" will use a fresh address on each invocation. The current address in the QR code on the main page changes as soon as coins are received on it.\n&gt;\n&gt;* When sending coins, the fee is shown while you type and before you press \"Send\". After sending, you'll see the paid fee in the transaction list.\n&gt;\n&gt;* When sending coins, most errors are now shown already before you press Send.\n&gt;\n&gt;* The app now requires Android 4.0.3 or higher. This makes UI development much easier in future.\n&gt;\n&gt;* The app has a fresher, sharper looking app icon. The icon for the testnet version is now entirely grey.\n&gt;\n&gt;* On Android 4.1 or higher, the app-widget is now horizontally resizable.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Based on bitcoinj 0.12.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks to everyone participating, especially to all of the bitcoinj team members and the busy translators on Transifex!﻿",

So from now on, only one backup is needed to recover all your future funds in that wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app does its best to not reuse addresses any more. &amp;quot;Request coins&amp;quot; will use a fresh address on each invocation. The current address in the QR code on the main page changes as soon as coins are received on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sending coins, the fee is shown while you type and before you press &amp;quot;Send&amp;quot;. After sending, you&amp;#39;ll see the paid fee in the transaction list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sending coins, most errors are now shown already before you press Send.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app now requires Android 4.0.3 or higher. This makes UI development much easier in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app has a fresher, sharper looking app icon. The icon for the testnet version is now entirely grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Android 4.1 or higher, the app-widget is now horizontally resizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on bitcoinj 0.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone participating, especially to all of the bitcoinj team members and the busy translators on Transifex!﻿&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Use 12 Bip39 words into the Bip39 pbkdf2 function with no password, then use the resulting output as a bip32 seed to generate a root bip32 private key, and then use bip44 for the accounts and addresses, with the first address on a fresh new bitcoin account being m/44'/0'/0'/0/0.  Trezor, being the first wallet to come out, does exactly the same thing except they have the password \"TREZOR\" in the bip39 pbkdf2 function.  All other wallets don't use a password.\n\nThat seems like an excellent standard to follow IMO.  It allows a 12 word seed, which everybody seems to like, bip44 allows version byte identifiers so different coins can be used, and then there's 2\\^31 hardened/non-hardened addresses per depth level, which ought to be plenty.  So you can have one master key for literally every coin that uses secp256k1 for its keys, and you could even have one chain be for multisig parts, and so on.  And with bip39, you can make a word list on any multiple of 4 bytes (32 bits), so people who want more than 128 bits can make longer word lists, and/or use a password in the pbkdf, and/or increase the pbkdf output.  Bip32 uses hmac-sha512, and I'm guessing that's good enough for everybody.\n\nOne of problems with Bip32 is that if you get a private key for a child key, and you have its parent's public key, you can work backwords and derive the parent public key, and then repeat the process and go all the way up the chain.  But hardened keys stop that in its tracks.  You can only derive up to a hardened parent but no beyond.  That's why the first few levels in m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 are hardened (as denoted by the apostrophe).  So if you get the key for the last zero, and you know the public key for middle 0', you can derive the private keys for everything below that 0'... but you can't go up any more beyond that.\n\nThe reason ALL keys aren't just hardened by default is that you can't generate hardened children from parent public keys, and so you need non-hardened keys if you want to manage multiple accounts used by different people, like say a company would.  But the child-private-key-deriving-parent-key problem is why you'll always see the chain of accounts almost always being hardened keys right up until the point where you're generating the keys that are actually being used.  That way if the private key for that collection gets compromised, you can just increment a notch above the hardened key and stop using that old chain. \n\nGah, I'm rambling.  The point is, the basic gist of this standard seems really solid all around as far as I'm concerned.  One 12 word mnemonic for everything, and it's perfectly secure.  And you can use it for almost anything, all with just the one root key.",

Use 12 Bip39 words into the Bip39 pbkdf2 function with no password, then use the resulting output as a bip32 seed to generate a root bip32 private key, and then use bip44 for the accounts and addresses, with the first address on a fresh new bitcoin account being m/44&amp;#39;/0&amp;#39;/0&amp;#39;/0/0.  Trezor, being the first wallet to come out, does exactly the same thing except they have the password &amp;quot;TREZOR&amp;quot; in the bip39 pbkdf2 function.  All other wallets don&amp;#39;t use a password.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That seems like an excellent standard to follow IMO.  It allows a 12 word seed, which everybody seems to like, bip44 allows version byte identifiers so different coins can be used, and then there&amp;#39;s 2^31 hardened/non-hardened addresses per depth level, which ought to be plenty.  So you can have one master key for literally every coin that uses secp256k1 for its keys, and you could even have one chain be for multisig parts, and so on.  And with bip39, you can make a word list on any multiple of 4 bytes (32 bits), so people who want more than 128 bits can make longer word lists, and/or use a password in the pbkdf, and/or increase the pbkdf output.  Bip32 uses hmac-sha512, and I&amp;#39;m guessing that&amp;#39;s good enough for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of problems with Bip32 is that if you get a private key for a child key, and you have its parent&amp;#39;s public key, you can work backwords and derive the parent public key, and then repeat the process and go all the way up the chain.  But hardened keys stop that in its tracks.  You can only derive up to a hardened parent but no beyond.  That&amp;#39;s why the first few levels in m/44&amp;#39;/0&amp;#39;/0&amp;#39;/0/0 are hardened (as denoted by the apostrophe).  So if you get the key for the last zero, and you know the public key for middle 0&amp;#39;, you can derive the private keys for everything below that 0&amp;#39;... but you can&amp;#39;t go up any more beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason ALL keys aren&amp;#39;t just hardened by default is that you can&amp;#39;t generate hardened children from parent public keys, and so you need non-hardened keys if you want to manage multiple accounts used by different people, like say a company would.
