If/when fiat dies, you could have a situation where the exchange price is either astronomically high or completely irrelevant, and bitcoin will have taken over as unit of account. \n\nSo I'm not sure what Andreas' full take on it was, but I would imagine that, as money, bitcoin is less useful, all things equal, the lower it's purchasing power and/or fiat exchange price.

Not only are these two things inseparable, but, even if by some twist of the nature of the universe they were separable; the power and usefulness of blockchain technology (though profoundly powerful in other ways besides money) is massively diminished if we don't ever use this technology to free money from the state and decentralize it.\n\n&gt;Value does not only come from the token of ownership. Value can also come from the utility of a specific blockchain with the token simply being a method of assignment.\n\nI agree.

Bitcoin and other blockchains or blockchain technology in general are, of course, not the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man in the video made claims to the effect that Bitcoin (the blockchain that is currently called &amp;quot;the bitcoin blockchain&amp;quot;) could be and would be useful only if we separated it from bitcoin the money.  This is a dangerous myth circulating, that is all too well fueled by widely existing misconceptions within the bitcoin space.  Not only are these two things inseparable, but, even if by some twist of the nature of the universe they were separable; the power and usefulness of blockchain technology (though profoundly powerful in other ways besides money) is massively diminished if we don&amp;#39;t ever use this technology to free money from the state and decentralize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Value does not only come from the token of ownership. Value can also come from the utility of a specific blockchain with the token simply being a method of assignment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree.  I&amp;#39;m really not sure where our misunderstandings are stemming from, but I will apologize as well if my posts are not concise or clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

How can it be fair when the people at the bottom are still at the bottom and a few new millionaires are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately who cares if the currency is changed? The potential rich people are the ones most interested in a paradigm change. Everyone else though, particularly the ones with no hope in todays fiat system or tomorrows bitcoin system can&amp;#39;t care any less what the currency is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For the love of disco, let me repeat:  It is not yet a currency.  It does not fulfill the three main requirements of a money to a high degree (medium of exchange; yes great.  store of value; not so great.  Unit of account; not at all . . . yet) And this unit of account aspect is key.  \n\nHow retarded or misleading can one be; to suggest that a commodity, or a would-be-money, is somehow fundamentally flawed, because it does not yet enjoy a great deal of liquidity and widespread adoption, or because it's exchange price with the current money is volatile!?  I mean: how else exactly do people imagine this phenomenon could possibly take place?  . .  .that one day, some magical company called Bitcoin Inc., should just pop on the scene and declare their unit in their digital blockchain ledger to be worth *X* amount, and it will just be so, because they declare it?  \n\nOnly governments can do this, because governments have guns, and a slightly insane population of state-worshipers who believe that their proof-of-violence kind of money is somehow a good thing for society.  Anyhow, regardless of how you feel about anarchy. . . it does not change the fact that valuation of a commodity is either forced and enforced. . . or it is emergent on a market.  It takes time, to say the least.  It cannot happen all at once, and it is going to be a messy, ugly, fits-and-starts, snafus, highly dis-equitable distributions initially, frauds, thefts, evolution of best practices and safeguards, etc.  A process of getting a large segment of the population to not only wrap their heads around a new technology to some extent. . . but to build out infrastructure to make it easier to use, and to have a large enough network of people and businesses demanding and accepting bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin cannot exist without the blockchain. . . but the blockchain **is** bitcoin.  There is no separating the two.  The level of ignorance and/or dishonesty to not contemplate and comprehend this fact, before so vociferously decrying the money aspect of it, is staggering.  One particularly ridiculous inconsistency of his argument, is that the exact type of \"separation\" of Bitcoin and bitcoin which he insisted upon (for uses such as remittances which he gave the example of), are already in existence, by way of companies such as Coinbase and Bitpay, which he lambasted.  There is no such thing as the coin people!  It's a fucking ledger.  No community utilizing blockchain technology as a decentralized network (i.e. not a single entity utilizing it internally and later transferring fiat balances between branches), can make any use of changing entries in a ledger unless the shares or units **have value**.  If they have no value, then no remittance network is possible, because there is no objective metric by which the sender and receiver could possibly determine how many units of the blockchain ledger should be assigned to the particular amount of fiat being sent, and how much fiat should be received at the other end in correspondence to those units of blockchain ledger.  The blockchain must have value, and indeed the units must have price.  This is inseparable from most any use of blockchain technology.  People need to get over their centralized, give-it-to-me now thinking; and understand the price discovery period which is going on with bitcoin.  \n\nBitcoin has the network effect, which is growing, and it is that network (of people) who give value to the bitcoin network, and subsequently the shares of that finite amount of units internal to the ledger.  That is what allows the network to be useful. . . for anything.\n\nI'm sorry, but if you think that this man brings up any valid points whatsoever. . . .please, please; just stop right now.  Get off reddit.  Please don't buy any bitcoin.  Please go back and read the Satoshi whitepaper.  Please go study economics. . . especially monetary history and the history of development of commodities into market-based currency.  You owe it to yourself to more fully understand this amazing technology, and the economic and political implications of it's properties and usefulness.  Money is memory.  Money is societal memory.  Having control over the issuance of money is the ultimate power over society, and it is a power far too great to entrust to governments and central banks. \n\nPlease understand where this man's rhetoric is coming from:  Bitcoin \"the payment network\" alone, is not threatening to anybody.  Bitcoin as money, is extremely threatening to a lot of groups.  There is a concerted effort to distract from this much more important aspect of bitcoin and to try to neuter it into being only a payments network, but also stifle it's development into end-to-end use as it's own unit of account; as money.\n\nEDIT: thanks very much for the gold, whoever you are.",

The short answer is no-one can be trusted, because this ruins the decentralised nature of the network.

Right now all nodes are equal and hold no greater importance than any other node. This makes it robust, and resistant to attack. In Bitcoin there are no weak nodes, and as long as one survives, the network can recover. Bitcoin's design right now is thoroughly decentralised which is what makes it so powerful as a tool and valuable as a currency (no third party risk was thought impossible before Bitcoin). Even with this decentralisation though, it is still vulnerable to DoS attacks and developers are constantly on the lookout for potential attacks, vulnerabilities and fixes. Making it even slightly more centralised is a bad idea.
