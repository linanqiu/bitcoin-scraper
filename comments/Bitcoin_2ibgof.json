As the market continues to fall and the year is closing out, this will be the worst year ever. Even if the slow steady slide fianlly stops, the price of bitcoin will probably still have a loss of over 60% since it&amp;#39;s all time high last November.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad news makes Bitcoin drop. Good news makes it drop too. That means that there are people waiting to exit. They want out. Big whales from the early days are cashing out. Little fish that can&amp;#39;t survive without an occasional sale are being forced to sell. Longs are going bust. And the people at Buttcoin? Guess what...they are throwing huge parties from all the money they made shorting cryptos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The newest TA lines show the price dropping to near $260. The $233 mark will probably get tested. Blood is everywhere. Some of it is yours. On a personal level, many of us are out on a limb. We believed in Bitcoin so strongly that we invested all our spare cash. We sold stock &amp;amp; precious metals and invested in BTC. We put off car repairs. We refused to spend money on luxuries. We avoided paying bills every time that BTC dropped and grabbed a bit more. We had faith. We HODL. Every drop in price was another grab. When the price went to $600, it was &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot;, BTC on sale. When it went to $500, it was &amp;quot;double wow&amp;quot;, BTC on big sale. When the price dropped to $400, it was &amp;quot;triple wow, super sale&amp;quot;. But we started to worry, we were out of money. Now we are down to almost $300 and it is &amp;quot;shit, I should buy more, but there is no money left&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. Fundamentals are great. There is good news everywhere. Circle is working. Payment providers are starting to accept Bitcoin. Newegg takes BTC, you can buy plane tickets with BTC, even PayPal is starting to integrate BTC. Yet the price keeps dropping like a rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened. There are two fundamentals working against Bitcoin right now. The first is mining. In the past, most miners were just computer nerds, they had other jobs and held onto most of their coins. They didn&amp;#39;t need to sell. It was an experiment for them. Half of them didn&amp;#39;t even think the concept would work, but it was fun to play with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now mining is done at huge farms. These places have to sell most of their bitcoins. Many are operating at a loss and have to sell all they get. Close to 3600 coins a day are being dumped on the market. The second thing is legacy mining. A lot of people from the old days have huge stockpiles of BTC. They retired. Now they slowly sell them off to pay living expenses. If the price drops in half, no problem, they just sell twice as many, they have thousands, maybe millions left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study previous bubbles. After a bubble, the market tends to form a bowl shaped pattern before the next big jump up in price. There is an all time high of about $1163 on Nov 29, 2013. Now we have a new sustained low of just over $300 on Oct 4, 2014. This is over 10 months. To complete the bowl shape will take at least another 10 months. Then there will be a short flag shape event with high volume as people that bought way back get out. They are just trying to recover their investment. Only after that will there be strong sustained growth (maybe even a new bubble). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you are waiting at least 10 months. That is a 50% probability. A 25% probability that it could be shorter (unexpected whale buying) and a 25% probability (more whales selling) that you will be waiting till 2016. That means a 75% probability that BTC price wont reach $1000 again till near the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we know that Bitcoin makes a lot of stuff obsolete as a store of value. Gold, Art, Land, Offshore Tax Havens. These are all obsolete. Super rich people (the 1%) don&amp;#39;t care though. They control the government. Fiat serves them nicely. They don&amp;#39;t want to support Bitcoin. They support the old system. They will avoid Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for the 99% (us) and we are mostly broke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does this all mean for you as an individual? If you are checking prices every day, you are probably in a state of deep depression. Your wife is telling you to cut your losses and sell. Your mom is hinting that you should attend Gambler&amp;#39;s Anonymous. You dad is disappointed in you. Your friends avoid you. Your kids are asking for their allowance. People call late at night. You have nightmares of Jesse from Breaking Bad busting down your door, holding a gun to your face and saying &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s my money...BIIIITCH&amp;quot;. Suicide hotline numbers are being posted \neverywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do you still have faith? Do you still believe in Bitcoin? If so, it is time for a vacation. Get away from it all. Create a brainwallet, send all your coins there. Get a backpack, collect your toothbrush and some comfortable clothes. Leave a note on the table: &amp;quot;See you in summer of 2016&amp;quot;. Take off. Go hitch-hiking. Live on the beach. Check out the soup kitchens. Go south to warmer weather. If you got the resources, go to Hawaii, it is the best state to be homeless. Why summer of 2016? Bitcoin should recover by then. 90% chance of being over $1200, with a 50% chance of hitting $2000 or higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t check the Bitcoin price till then. Make yourself wait. Read books &amp;amp; magazines at the library, but don&amp;#39;t go online. Don&amp;#39;t even touch a computer, you will be tempted to check, discover the price is still down, and go back to being depressed. You have to go cold turkey. No price checking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do this? Here is the problem with waiting. Half of the stress and anxiety is from all the people that expect you to support them or to pay your bills. They nag and harass you, which causes stress. You are overextend, bitcoin prices are abysmal. You could sell them now and get some relief. But guess what, in a few years bitcoin will recover, but you won&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I know this? Several decades ago, I bought $2000 worth of Microsoft shortly after they went public. That stock is worth over a million dollars now. Do I still have it? No, I sold it to pay rent when it was still worth $2000 (I was unemployed for six months). I supported my family. BTW, that wife abandoned me several years later. I should have just left them and been homeless for a few years. Then I would be a millionaire. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will your family leave you? I don&amp;#39;t know. If they do, you can get another one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to be rich, you have to make it your #1 priority. There is no other way. Most people only get one chance per lifetime. Many don&amp;#39;t even get that. This is your chance. Don&amp;#39;t blow it.  Keep HODLing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
