Within Case 2 there are three sub-cases: 2a) They spent because they felt they were holding too many bitcoins, meaning they are spending in lieu of selling, meaning no price impact; 2b) They spent even though they felt they were holding the exact right amount of bitcoins, meaning now they feel they have too few, meaning they will feel pressure to buy more even if not immediately, meaning no price impact beyond the short term; 2c) They spent even though they felt they were holding too few bitcoins already, meaning they will feel even bigger pressure to buy back, even sooner, which is again no impact beyond the short term. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all case price impact is neutral from this effect, except short term blips. And of course there is latent positive price pressure thanks to good PR and Bitcoin becoming more useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
