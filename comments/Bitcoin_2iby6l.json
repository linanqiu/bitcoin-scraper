But i get what are you are saying and of course that is also a big factor. In a sense so it is the whole capital flight Bitcoin has experienced going to altcois or metacoins in Bitcoin.  But the only constant vicious circle continues to be sell pressure from non-holding transactions + hashrate explosive rise squeezing Miners to sell = price downwards over a long period of time.  One of the solutions is Bitcoin getting as easy and fast to purchase with a constant reliability as it is to spend it. Since spending is also not holding and that is bad for the price.
