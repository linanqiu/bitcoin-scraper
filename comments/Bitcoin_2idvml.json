One of the main topics is Regulation of bitcoin by the united states. Basically, the law being debated is that every electronic transmition of bitcoin in the US must be registered with the federal reserve, and every transaction not registed will be considred illegal. Also, anyone who doesnt record a bitcoin transaction will be subject to a fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help give me a general overview of potential arguments for or against this law? Im kinda drawing a blank, as im not really well versed in the subject, surely not as knowledgable as the people on this subreddit.
