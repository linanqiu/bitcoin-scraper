It’s like a Bitcoin ATM, but you can take it anywhere!\n* Buy Bitcoin, Receive Bitcoin from QR code or a Coinkite card\n* Print Paper Wallets with private key and also redeemable online\n* Print Vouchers with PIN and redeemable online\n* Exchange Rate Markup can easily be set by you\n* Scan to Pay the sold coins directly into your customer's wallet\n\n&gt; Retail Mode\n\n* Accept Bitcoin from any wallet by printing a QR code\n* Accept Debit Cards from Coinkite users\n* Receive Tips by simply choosing the amount\n* Book Keeping with options for Table Number, Invoice Number, etc...\n* View Unpaid Bills on screen list of unconfirmed transactions for each table\n* Add Markup by setting your exchange premium.
