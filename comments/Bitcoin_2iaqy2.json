It seems like everything is pretty much good to go at this point and all that's left is the green light from the SEC which could happen at anytime.\n\nAlso, according to Barry Silbert, he plans to bring the Bitcoin Investment Trust to a publicly traded setting this Q4 on the OTCCQX so if things go according to plan we would have two publicly available choices. We also have the Nasdaq Vice President of Transaction Services and Head of ETF business David LaValle calling the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust a \"significant\" development for the exchange-traded fund industry in August.

It seems like everything is pretty much good to go at this point and all that&amp;#39;s left is the green light from the SEC which could happen at anytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, according to Barry Silbert, he plans to bring the Bitcoin Investment Trust to a publicly traded setting this Q4 on the OTCCQX so if things go according to plan we would have two publicly available choices. We also have the Nasdaq Vice President of Transaction Services and Head of ETF business David LaValle calling the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust a &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; development for the exchange-traded fund industry in August.
