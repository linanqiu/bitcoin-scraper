                                "body": "&gt; Acquiring bitcoin has gotten easier too, but I think managing it is still a struggle for many. In addition to improved wallet software, I hope we start seeing more and more incentive for people to actually start using it. Still so much work to do.\n\nIndeed, I'm with you. I think it's interesting to look at the 'ease' and the 'use' though, it's sadly very poorly matched. I'll explain what I mean to anyone who can be bothered :p\n\nIn countries where bitcoin has marginal consumer benefits, acquiring bitcoin has become a lot easier, and there's a decent amount of technical awareness (computer-literate population, high internet penetration), bitcoin education (large English-based communities, documentation, journalism, software and guides), evangelizing on corporate media (CNN, Bloomberg etc). These markets are serviced quite comprehensively. I can send free SEPA transactions to multiple exchanges and buy bitcoin cheaply and quickly (Europe). In the US there has been Coinbase, now Circle.\n\nBut what are the main consumer benefits? The dollar is relatively stable. Card fees are relatively low and on the merchant side. Deposits are FDIC insured up to $250k. Payments online for consumers happen instantly, with fraud protections. Online and in stores payments are already relatively frictionless.\n\nUnless you count influence in monetary and foreign policy by disassociation from the federal banking system a consumer benefit, it's all pretty marginal. \n\nThen there's places where access to bitcoin is limited.

If merchants really experience 2-3% fees and 1-2% fraud costs, and experience 30-day payments from their processor, I think it makes sense to structurally offer 1-5% discounts on bitcoin sales. Not as a promotion, just permanently. With thuisbezorgd we have this, the $1.25 in CC fees they charge aren't there for bitcoin, and as it's like the eBay for takeaway restaurants, saving $1.25 on a $10 pizza delivery is a significant cost saving, and they pass it along to the customer. I really hope we can do a November push to get merchants to understand and appreciate this en masse, and that Coinbase/Bitpay really push the conversation with their large merchants. At that point, combining Circle with structural discounts, we may see some momentum from mainstream consumers. Getting a 2% discount on a $1000 Macbook is worth considering. And beyond that, I really hope we can see some non-OECD countries get service. I'd love to see BitPesa's charts for 2014 in a few months, and I hope we'll get one for the Phillipines. They have an exchange, we have Circle, and it's a leading remittance corridor. Let's make that happen.\n\n\n",

I think it&amp;#39;s interesting to look at the &amp;#39;ease&amp;#39; and the &amp;#39;use&amp;#39; though, it&amp;#39;s sadly very poorly matched. I&amp;#39;ll explain what I mean to anyone who can be bothered :p&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In countries where bitcoin has marginal consumer benefits, acquiring bitcoin has become a lot easier, and there&amp;#39;s a decent amount of technical awareness (computer-literate population, high internet penetration), bitcoin education (large English-based communities, documentation, journalism, software and guides), evangelizing on corporate media (CNN, Bloomberg etc). These markets are serviced quite comprehensively. I can send free SEPA transactions to multiple exchanges and buy bitcoin cheaply and quickly (Europe). In the US there has been Coinbase, now Circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what are the main consumer benefits? The dollar is relatively stable. Card fees are relatively low and on the merchant side. Deposits are FDIC insured up to $250k. Payments online for consumers happen instantly, with fraud protections.
