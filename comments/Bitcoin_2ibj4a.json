The price of bitcoin is irrelevant to a silk road user. If I want $500 worth of product, I'll buy $500 worth of bitcoin. Whether that means i need to buy 500 coins, 5,000 coins, or 0.44453927 coins is completely irrelevant.\n\nTo calculate a true \"worth\" you need to find a reason for people to need 1 bitcoin, and silk road is not that.",
