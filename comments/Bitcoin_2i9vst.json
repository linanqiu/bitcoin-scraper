If I re-interpret what he can mean by that in the political space, it means Bitcoin will be Plan B against serious government/central bank corruption or fuck ups for the next 20 years (e.g. future bailouts, uncontrolled inflation, spiral of debt).

If I re-interpret what he can mean by that in the political space, it means Bitcoin will be Plan B against serious government/central bank corruption or fuck ups for the next 20 years (e.g. future bailouts, uncontrolled inflation, spiral of debt).
