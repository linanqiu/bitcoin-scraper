While it's easy enough for my computer to generate umpteenthousands of addresses every day, somebody with a whole network of computers, or even a botnet, can easily generate multitudes more.\n\nNote that this is considering only your lotto idea.  If the actual mining algorithm were changed, expect everybody and their dog to move to Scrypt-based coins as those still have efficient hardware mining solutions, and things will simply concentrate again from there.\n\nAlso note that this is in some form of reality where any such change would even gain enough of a following to warrant a fork that starts with the then-current blockchain, and progresses from there; otherwise you might as well just launch a new coin... in which case, there's already plenty to choose from.",

While it&amp;#39;s easy enough for my computer to generate umpteenthousands of addresses every day, somebody with a whole network of computers, or even a botnet, can easily generate multitudes more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that this is considering only your lotto idea.  If the actual mining algorithm were changed, expect everybody and their dog to move to Scrypt-based coins as those still have efficient hardware mining solutions, and things will simply concentrate again from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also note that this is in some form of reality where any such change would even gain enough of a following to warrant a fork that starts with the then-current blockchain, and progresses from there; otherwise you might as well just launch a new coin... in which case, there&amp;#39;s already plenty to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
