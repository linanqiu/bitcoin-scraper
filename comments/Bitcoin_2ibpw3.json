Each fund we launch has a 30 day funding period, where anyone can signup on our website and pledge their BTC (minimum .25 BTC) to the fund.  Users can watch as the BTC Fuel meter automatically increases with each deposit and the Liftoff ticker counts down to launch! At the end of the 30 day funding period, deposits are closed and pledged funds are transferred to our secure trading system where our professional team launches the official trading period and the real fun begins! Once trading begins, users can watch as our advanced portfolio management software displays the portfolio balance and trades as they happen. Our users can literally log in, see how the investment fund is doing at any time, and even chat with us and other investors all in the same place!  At the end of the trading period, all positions are closed and the final BTC balance is transferred to our secure payout system.  Our skilled accounting team then calculates your individual proportionate share of the portfolio and sends your earnings to your unique deposit address.\n\nNo information on what exactly they're gonna be trading, their trading credentials or anything else. Instead, colourful feel-good neologisms like \"BTC Fuel meter\" and \"Liftoff ticker (counts down to launch)\". What could go wrong?",
