I&amp;#39;m a regular in &lt;a href=\"/r/pf\"&gt;/r/pf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoin\"&gt;/r/bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoinmarkets\"&gt;/r/bitcoinmarkets&lt;/a&gt; but I chose to make this account because my girlfriend is a redditor too and I don&amp;#39;t want to get any backlash by posting this on my main account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that reason I need to obfuscate some details of my story but I think you guys will understand. I&amp;#39;m in a pretty bad situation and I need some advice on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I became in charge of my family&amp;#39;s finances. One of my parents passed much earlier than expected. My remaining parent didn&amp;#39;t understand anything about finance or investing so I naturally stepped in to take over things and try to plan something for our family so that we could be financially secure for at least 10 or 15 years, enough time for me to get to a position in my career where I could take care of everyone with my own income stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started learning about trading, first with Forex. I was trading EURUSD and USDJPY primarily just with small amounts at first. Spent a lot of time on babypips.com learning technical analysis and how to extract as much value as possible from chart patterns. When I started I just used small amounts of money. My initial bankroll was $500. I ended up using too much leverage and blowing through my whole account because of some poorly time trades. Yes I know I should have used some common sense and not taken gigantic risks but I was just learning at the time. I worked at it a bit and started getting profitable. I would usually do my work late at night watching charts and drinking espressos, and there were several times that I took positions that netted me large profits so I&amp;#39;m confident that I&amp;#39;ve learned from my early mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about a year and a half ago I started hearing about bitcoin, and how it was getting more valuable. I started reading about the blockchain, and this technology that is going to revolutionize the way the world thinks about money. I was excited about it, truly. I knew in my heart that this was going to be gigantic. So I took a leap. I took about half of all the cash I had in my checking account and deposited it at Mt.Gox. I didn&amp;#39;t use any of the inheritance money, just my own from my part time job while I was a college student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I know. Terrible idea in hindsight. I never got the money out before the whole thing collapsed. I wish I hadn&amp;#39;t done it, but at the same time it wasn&amp;#39;t a great deal of money to learn a lesson. That we can&amp;#39;t just trust individual exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I learned a lot during that experience. I spent a lot of time analyzing charts. I learned how to use MACD and RSI indicators. I started getting good at being able to time things and on paper (of course) I was making very good profits. It&amp;#39;s a shame that I didn&amp;#39;t cash out before the whole thing went to shit because I probably would have enough money to last atleast a few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after Gox, I became really depressed but I still believed in bitcoin. I still thought it was going to be around for a very long time so I started looking for some more honest exchanges. I knew that what happened to me was just an unfortunate event that was unlikely to happen again. After all, Gox was being run by a pretty shady group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I picked myself back up, I decided to deposit some of the inheritance money in some legitimate exchanges. In total we had about $300k after medical bills and other issues from the settlement of the estate. It was sitting in a checking account until about April of this year. I decided to put in $50k into two exchanges to diversify my risk exposure. Half I put into bitfinex and the other half I put into bitstamp. I spent 7 to 10 hours a day trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I&amp;#39;ve been taking mostly long positions. Every time the price drops 30 to 40 dollars I have been telling myself &lt;strong&gt;this is it&lt;/strong&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;this is the bottom&lt;/strong&gt; and will take a position to make up for previous losses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot understand why this is happening. I made some serious money several times but for the past 6 months or so I have taken huge losses. After the initial 50k I deposited another 50k, and then after losing much of that, and determining (wrongly, I might add, but I don&amp;#39;t think my analysis was wrong) that we were definitely at the bottom, I went on to deposit another 125k. So far I am down a lot. My average cost per bitcoin is around $623.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The losses just keep compounding. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;m getting incredibly desperate and sallow. I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m going to explain this to my family. They know very little about bitcoin, but I have mentioned it on occasion and how I&amp;#39;m an enthusiast. I&amp;#39;ve even sent my sister and cousins some bitcoin to get them started. But now I&amp;#39;m worried that maybe this isn&amp;#39;t going to work out. Every day I get out of bed and dread looking at the price of bitcoin. Because I know its going to translate into losses on the positions I&amp;#39;ve taken. I have tried really hard to avoid looking at the price but at this point I cannot take it any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just looking for a reason, any reason, to believe that things are going to get better. So far I&amp;#39;ve lost a lot of the estate money and I&amp;#39;ll do anything to get it back. But I&amp;#39;m getting to the point where I feel like I might need to get to grips with reality and just cut my losses, admit to my family what I did and try to make it up to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I ask of you, please convince me one way or another (with some solid reasoning) to either sell all the coins I have on margin right now or just hold fast and weather this storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If I buy at $50 and the price appreciates back to $100 I've covered my losses'.\n\nNo. You do NOTHING. If the price appreciates back to $100, you'll have covered your losses. What you are doing is 'doubling down'. It's completely different. And looking at the level of thought and level of risk you're taking, you're pretty much gambling with your money.\n\nIf you believe, in the above example, that the price will appreciate back to $100, then be confident and patient. You've risked some money, but it can be okay. If you don't believe it, then why invest even more money if you think you'll lose that, too?\n\nI just can't fathom HOW you can risk everything, hundreds of thousands, money you saved, worked for, money you inherited, without spending 5 minutes looking at the price chart.\n\nIf you did, you'd have seen that the price of bitcoin collapsed many times, numerous times by 50%. In 2011 it dropped by more than 90%, from $30 or so to $2 or so. In 2012 it dropped from $7 to $4 and from $13 to $8 and in 2013 from $230 to $80.\n\nIf it's any surprise to you that bitcoin could, for months, drop in value, you're simply not looking. And if you're not looking and investing over $100k, you're gambling!\n\nSTOP. Just stop. Don't double down, don't invest more than you can lose. Just stop. If you believe in bitcoin, great, I do, remain ownership of the bitcoin you can lose without bankrupting you and your family and not a penny more.  But don't double down and invest more than you're willing to lose. And for the love of god, stop obsessing about the price. Do something fun, go work, do stuff with friends and family. You've got a beautiful life to live regardless of bitcoin. If you're obsessed with bitcoin, start a company or a service. But you can't make the price change no matter how many days you look at the chart. Never obsess about price. Let it go, invest what you could afford to lose in a worst case scenario, and enjoy the vastly bigger and more important rest of your life.",

Merchant adoption has progressed well but thats to be expected as companies like bitpay have enabled companies to accept crypto at no cost. This ensures that the currency is taken seriously enough to avoid crashes to zero dollars but doesn't support a market cap of ten billion dollars. The price got driven up during the euphoric phase by speculators like you and I, but many of those have now divested.....but they will stay interested. What we need to watch for now are signs of genuine consumer interest and 'killer apps'. Im not sure I feel comfortable telling you to hold or sell but I would judge it on the number of wallet downloads and any interesting news coming from the remittance side of the markrt.

Keep in mind: he has *already* lost every penny he put in several times and is still trying to add more and use leverage and prayer to dig his way out. The appropriate thing to do would be to cash out, give the remaining money to his family, and then say, “I think you could make it back by putting it into Bitcoin, but I recognize that I long ago lost the right to make that decision for you”. \n\nOh, and did you do the math?

Working in finance, and having spent most of my young life following financial markets, I can understand the mentality of those in underwater positions.  While I don't trade in securities, anyone who has held a position has been in the scenario of looking at his names in red, thinking, \"I only wish it would just bounce back so I can sell and exhale!\"\n\nI think there's enough criticism going around here (some outright mean, some justified, some both), so I'll skip that.  As for the solution, I think you've at least performed a small step in writing that post, thereby actualizing what you already cognitively sense: that you're in a world of financial trouble.\n\nThere will be enough time to do a post-mortem on your follies and the steps that got you here.  Right now, you need to act in a responsible manner as you've given yourself the role of fiduciary.  I'm not a financial advisory expert, nor am I even decent at personal finance matters, but I do know risk when I see it.  BTC is not an asset in which any fiduciary would be invested, full stop.\n\nYou have two options, one seemingly more pleasant than the other:  1) divest &amp; 'fess up, 2) try to make up the losses through either BTC or other financial instruments.  The tone of your post implies a preference for option no. 2, which, does give you a chance at recovery, and will probably entail chasing long bets and risking more funds for paltry gains.  With option 2, you'll be going toe to toe with probability, hoping that your 10:1 against bet will pay off your 3:1 payoff.  And you might win your freak bets and that glimmer of hope might provide some salve for your current straits.\n\nBut I think you wrote that post knowing that option no. 1 is the only option there is.  Don't do anything rash; there are people you can call in times of emotional crisis.\n\nWith Empathy,\n\nJB\n\n ",

Half I put into bitfinex and the other half I put into bitstamp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you made mistakes, learned a lot from it... then made the same mistake and learned a lot from it... then made the same mistake again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I ask of you, please convince me one way or another (with some solid reasoning) to either sell all the coins I have on margin right now or just hold fast and weather this storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here you are asking redditors to help you make the same mistakes again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If perhaps you are not trolling, I suspect there is some very strong cognitive bias at work here, so I urge other fellow redditors not to aggravate your situation by actually trying to tell you what to do with your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

When the price sank below $600 &lt;a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/v/HvkyjwBQ/\"&gt;I expected the price to only fall only down to $450&lt;/a&gt;. But we didn&amp;#39;t bounce there.

Yes, I mean bitcoin and how it's in early stages, bla bla bla, but more importantly, it's earlier in your life than you can imagine.  You are so young and there is plenty of time and opportunity to recover from losses that may seem tragic right now.  That's not an invitation to be reckless with your decisions going forward, but to understand that it's not too late with respect to, well, anything.  You have a lifetime of decisions to make and appear to be learning some hard lessons early, which will hopefully only inform and improve you going forward.\n\nHenry Ford himself said that you must invest in yourself while young, invest in your education and preparing yourself by mastering your tools, and that he didn't start saving until he was forty years old.  What that means is that you are right to be taking risks, but the problem is you are taking the wrong kinds of risks.  Gambling your family's money for a quick buck is not improving yourself and certainly not preparing for anything.  Keep in mind investment also includes dedicating your time and energy, not just your money.  In other words, don't chase money --- chase knowledge, understanding, and your passions.  That should be your focus.\n\nWith respect to your investment into bitcoin, the best thing you can do is approach your family about it.  If it's everyone's money, and not just yours, you have an obligation to inform them what's happening.  Regardless of their reaction, you'll feel alot better about it.  It'll be a family problem, and you won't have to carry the weight yourself.  Then, after they yell at you, you can explain the benefits and risks of bitcoin, and you can all decide together what to do.  \n\nI personally believe in bitcoin, but not because it has the potential to make me money.  It's the reverse -- I believe in the value of the technology and its ability to make some positive changes in our world, and I want to support that system with my investment -- putting my money where my mouth is.  Yes, it has the potential to give me a nice return, which is definitely part of it, but that's the effect, not the purpose.  If you are only looking for high returns without a deeper appreciation for the technology and what it can do, maybe bitcoin is not the right investment for you. \n\ntl;dr -- Fess up, learn something, get some sleep\n \n",

It&amp;#39;ll be a family problem, and you won&amp;#39;t have to carry the weight yourself.  Then, after they yell at you, you can explain the benefits and risks of bitcoin, and you can all decide together what to do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally believe in bitcoin, but not because it has the potential to make me money.  It&amp;#39;s the reverse -- I believe in the value of the technology and its ability to make some positive changes in our world, and I want to support that system with my investment -- putting my money where my mouth is.  Yes, it has the potential to give me a nice return, which is definitely part of it, but that&amp;#39;s the effect, not the purpose.  If you are only looking for high returns without a deeper appreciation for the technology and what it can do, maybe bitcoin is not the right investment for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr -- Fess up, learn something, get some sleep&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

            "body": "&gt; My average cost per bitcoin is around $623.\n\nThe problem for you is that there are lot of people in your situation. There are bagholders at every level now, 400s, 500s, 600s, 700s, 800s, 900s, 1000s, 1100s, 1200s, etc. And they want to get out. Not only that, the early adopters have been dumping a lot of their bitcoins on companies like tigerdirect, overstock, dell, etc. These companies need to sell their bitcoins to get cash. So with all these bagholders and companies looking to sell, along with the early investors looking at every opportunity to dump their bitcoins, there are lots of sell pressure for the foreseeable future. \n\nRight now bitcoins are thinly traded so the-powers-that-be may manipulate the price higher to lure more noobs into the game. If that happens, you will have an opportunity to dump your coins. But who knows. My guess is that the price will continue to bleed lower.\n\n\n&gt; So I ask of you, please convince me one way or another (with some solid reasoning) to either sell all the coins I have on margin right now or just hold fast and weather this storm.\n\nWhat? You can trade bitcoins on margin? Amazing. If you are trading with margin, you may not have a choice. Your broker may liquidate you if the price drops to a certain level. \n\n\nFirst of all, only you can decide whether or when to cut your losses. \n\nSecondly, you shouldn't be asking /r/bitcoin because /r/bitcoin is a scam subreddit run by pump and dump scammers. \n\n\nLook at the prominent bitcoiners. They are mostly criminals and thieves. Roger Ver, Mark Karpales, charlie shrem, etc. Bunch of money grubbing jews trying to steal your money. ",
