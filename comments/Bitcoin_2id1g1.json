I have only been at the Senate a year and a half, but this is clearly one of \nthe best panels I have had the privilege of working with.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I view my role on this file as to assist, in a meaningful way, innovation, as you have \ndiscussed today. That's how I'm trying to look at this. How do we assist this innovative technology, this \ndisruptive technology, as you referred to? You have to help me. We had a lot of conversation today started \nby our chairman around regulation or not. \n\nI would need specifics. What would you like this committee to do to assist the development of this, right \nto the point? What would you like us to do? Maybe the answer is nothing, and if that's the answer, tell us. \nBut if there is something that you need to do to enhance Canada's position as a destination for innovation, \n\nI want to know that. *Let's cut right to the chase: Tell us what you need from us*.\n\n**Mr. Perklin**: I'll start. I'm sure each one of my colleagues will have comments.\nOne of the things that would be beneficial to the innovation that my company is trying to provide to \nCanadians is the ability to open a bank account. When I am accepting funds from my customers in exchange for my services, I want to accept a cheque, but I cannot accept a cheque because my company has no bank account. I'm unable to do that. At the end of my tax year, when it comes time to remit payment to the government, I have no ability to write a cheque to give the Canadian government the money they deserve for the business I've conducted here in Canada. Instead, I have to have one of my employees write a cheque to the government on behalf of my company, and then I can reimburse them with bitcoin, because we cannot accept funds in any other way than cash.\nTo answer your question specifically, Senator Black, one I thing I would love to see is the ability for \nbitcoin businesses in Canada to open bank accounts at our major banks.\n\n**Mr. Hoegner**: I think we would very much appreciate the focus and ability of the crypto-currency \necosystem to focus on arriving at its own solutions and to see how this plays out in at least the short to \nmedium term. Bearing in mind the changes that have been made in Bill C-31 and in the regulations that are \nforthcoming, I would love to see this committee understand what crypto-currency is, really get its arms \naround what crypto-currency is, and not necessarily make any policy changes at this point.\n\n**Mr. Babin-Tremblay**: One outstanding issue is the taxation classification of bitcoin. The CRA classified it, I think, as a non-appreciating capital asset. Obviously, with Bill C-31, it's being included in the proceeds of money laundering and whatever the name of that thing is. You guys know.\n\nOne of the key dangers here that we have to avoid is to come up with some sort of double taxation \nscheme for bitcoin. If you treat it as a commodity, as for capital gains purposes, you cannot also charge sales tax and treat it also like a currency. That is one of the main outstanding issues that needs to be resolved: In which category does it fall for taxation purposes? I am sure Jillian has suggestions here, but from an entrepreneur, that's one of the important outstanding issues that needs to be cleared.\n\n**Ms. Friedman**: I think Mr. Hoegner spelled out very well what I would have said as an answer. I would \nadd approach this questioning in the spirit of competition between different technologies and institutions \nthat provide financial services and in a way that is as technologically neutral as possible. \nIf you look at different services being provided, it wouldn't be fair to say that an exchange that has the \nsame risk of money laundering, for example, changing from euros to Canadian dollars, has to follow this set of rules, but an exchange using digital currency to Canadian dollars doesn't have to follow this set of rules. If the risk is the same and they are providing a similar function, then by virtue of the idea of technological neutrality, it should be legislated similarly. \n\n**Mr. Babin-Tremblay**: It would be the opposite road to take than what they have been doing in New \nYork. In New York, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, came up with a proposal for \nbit licences, which was negatively received by the bitcoin industry for a number of reasons, most of them \nbeing that they are not technology-neutral. They are imposing additional requirements to bitcoin companies \nto comply with. That will most likely result in the isolation of New York and businesses moving out of the \nstate of New York into friendlier jurisdiction, because it is impossible to comply from a technical perspective.\n\n**Mr. Pouliot**: The important key point is not to discriminate against bitcoin just because it is a different \ntechnology, to look at it from the functions and uses of what people are doing with the bitcoins.\nThe community doesn't ask for much; I think I speak on behalf of most of the community when we say \nthat we're not particularly inclined to go to government for extra help. But, for instance, some ministers in \nthe U.K. have made positive statements regarding bitcoin. I'm speaking particularly of the U.K. where the \nminister of finance announced that he believed the U.K. could become a bitcoin hub. The community is \nreceptive to government statements about bitcoin, so I think positive statements from our governments \nsaying they think it's a great innovation -- and Canada does actually have a great potential in bitcoin -- just \nstating that fact, the symbolism of it, is enough.",

That is one of the main outstanding issues that needs to be resolved: In which category does it fall for taxation purposes? I am sure Jillian has suggestions here, but from an entrepreneur, that&amp;#39;s one of the important outstanding issues that needs to be cleared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ms. Friedman&lt;/strong&gt;: I think Mr. Hoegner spelled out very well what I would have said as an answer. I would \nadd approach this questioning in the spirit of competition between different technologies and institutions \nthat provide financial services and in a way that is as technologically neutral as possible. \nIf you look at different services being provided, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be fair to say that an exchange that has the \nsame risk of money laundering, for example, changing from euros to Canadian dollars, has to follow this set of rules, but an exchange using digital currency to Canadian dollars doesn&amp;#39;t have to follow this set of rules. If the risk is the same and they are providing a similar function, then by virtue of the idea of technological neutrality, it should be legislated similarly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Babin-Tremblay&lt;/strong&gt;: It would be the opposite road to take than what they have been doing in New \nYork. In New York, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, came up with a proposal for \nbit licences, which was negatively received by the bitcoin industry for a number of reasons, most of them \nbeing that they are not technology-neutral. They are imposing additional requirements to bitcoin companies \nto comply with. That will most likely result in the isolation of New York and businesses moving out of the \nstate of New York into friendlier jurisdiction, because it is impossible to comply from a technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Pouliot&lt;/strong&gt;: The important key point is not to discriminate against bitcoin just because it is a different \ntechnology, to look at it from the functions and uses of what people are doing with the bitcoins.\nThe community doesn&amp;#39;t ask for much; I think I speak on behalf of most of the community when we say \nthat we&amp;#39;re not particularly inclined to go to government for extra help. But, for instance, some ministers in \nthe U.K. have made positive statements regarding bitcoin. I&amp;#39;m speaking particularly of the U.K. where the \nminister of finance announced that he believed the U.K. could become a bitcoin hub. The community is \nreceptive to government statements about bitcoin, so I think positive statements from our governments \nsaying they think it&amp;#39;s a great innovation -- and Canada does actually have a great potential in bitcoin -- just \nstating that fact, the symbolism of it, is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
