A **shadowy corporation** has funded attack ads directed at the Republican, see here, here, and here. The corporation in question has not disclosed the source of its funding for the ads to the Federal Election Commission. It is possible that the money for the ads came from commercial transactions and thus has no relationship to the relative strength of public opinion in Kentucky. Prior to Citizens United such spending by corporations was illegal, right? It will be a great day for democracy when **shadowy corporations** like this one can no longer fund attack ads directed at American voters.\n\nhttp://www.downsizinggovernment.org/corruption-rewarded-government\n\n&gt; Another example of abuse engineered by Senator Stevens involves Alaska Native Corporations. Because of rule changes slipped in by Stevens, these **shadowy businesses** based in his state are allowed to circumvent normal federal procurement rules and win no-bid contracts.\n\nAs you can see there are 6 pages of 'shadowy' in their bullshit machine's archives.",

Sure, some modern liberals – like Sean Wilentz – have argued that libertarianism is a Very Bad Thing, and that the enemy of my enemy must be my friend, even if my newfound friend is the &lt;strong&gt;shadowy guy&lt;/strong&gt; in the heart of the panopticon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cato.org/blog/google-illuminates-shadowy-world-national-security-letters\"&gt;http://www.cato.org/blog/google-illuminates-shadowy-world-national-security-letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Google illuminates the &lt;strong&gt;shadowy world&lt;/strong&gt; of National Security Letters&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cato.org/blog/new-campaign-finance-horrors\"&gt;http://www.cato.org/blog/new-campaign-finance-horrors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For (Rand) Paul, new troubles have appeared. A &lt;strong&gt;shadowy corporation&lt;/strong&gt; has funded attack ads directed at the Republican, see here, here, and here. The corporation in question has not disclosed the source of its funding for the ads to the Federal Election Commission. It is possible that the money for the ads came from commercial transactions and thus has no relationship to the relative strength of public opinion in Kentucky. Prior to Citizens United such spending by corporations was illegal, right? It will be a great day for democracy when &lt;strong&gt;shadowy corporations&lt;/strong&gt; like this one can no longer fund attack ads directed at American voters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/corruption-rewarded-government\"&gt;http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/corruption-rewarded-government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another example of abuse engineered by Senator Stevens involves Alaska Native Corporations. Because of rule changes slipped in by Stevens, these &lt;strong&gt;shadowy businesses&lt;/strong&gt; based in his state are allowed to circumvent normal federal procurement rules and win no-bid contracts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are 6 pages of &amp;#39;shadowy&amp;#39; in their bullshit machine&amp;#39;s archives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
