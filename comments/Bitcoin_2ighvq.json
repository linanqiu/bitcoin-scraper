The actual number chosen at the beginning doesn't matter.\n\nIf you want to understand how price discovery could work in the Bitcoin P2P network, you need to identify the scarce resources, and then identify the supply and demand factors.\n\nStart with the bandwidth needed to move transactions from the users to the miners. This is a scarce (not infinite) resource. It's supplied by relay nodes and the demand comes from the users who want to transact on the network. There is some equilibrium price where the willingness of relay nodes to supply bandwidth meets the demand of users. (don't worry for the moment about whether this price is positive or negative, just note that a price exists).\n\nThere's another side to this bandwidth, however. Imagine for a moment there is no block subsidy and miners derive all their revenue from transaction fees.\n\nThe transactions which pay the miners are _also_ a scarce resource. It's entirely conceivable that miners would pay relay nodes to deliver fee-paying transaction to them, for the exact same reason that a steel mill pays suppliers to provide it with iron ore.\n\nThe bandwith needed to transport the block a miner produces to the rest of the network is also a scarce recource, that has an equilibrium price.\n\nKeep in mind also that all these people who want to get paid for providing various services only do get paid if the Bitcoin network continues to function.\n\nThis isn't a complete description of how market allocation could work, but it should be clear that price discovery is possible. Once there was a functioning market for bandwidth/connectivity, then you wouldn't have to worry about blocks being \"too big\" for the exact same reason that we don't have to worry that all the grocery stores in town will suddenly decide to stock \"too many\" gallons of milk.",

The actual number chosen at the beginning doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand how price discovery could work in the Bitcoin P2P network, you need to identify the scarce resources, and then identify the supply and demand factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start with the bandwidth needed to move transactions from the users to the miners. This is a scarce (not infinite) resource. It&amp;#39;s supplied by relay nodes and the demand comes from the users who want to transact on the network. There is some equilibrium price where the willingness of relay nodes to supply bandwidth meets the demand of users. (don&amp;#39;t worry for the moment about whether this price is positive or negative, just note that a price exists).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another side to this bandwidth, however. Imagine for a moment there is no block subsidy and miners derive all their revenue from transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The transactions which pay the miners are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a scarce resource. It&amp;#39;s entirely conceivable that miners would pay relay nodes to deliver fee-paying transaction to them, for the exact same reason that a steel mill pays suppliers to provide it with iron ore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bandwith needed to transport the block a miner produces to the rest of the network is also a scarce recource, that has an equilibrium price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind also that all these people who want to get paid for providing various services only do get paid if the Bitcoin network continues to function.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a complete description of how market allocation could work, but it should be clear that price discovery is possible. Once there was a functioning market for bandwidth/connectivity, then you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about blocks being &amp;quot;too big&amp;quot; for the exact same reason that we don&amp;#39;t have to worry that all the grocery stores in town will suddenly decide to stock &amp;quot;too many&amp;quot; gallons of milk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If fees are too high, then no one will want to use Bitcoin for transactions directly. In this case, transaction would usually be done by sending money through semi-centralized intermediaries. For example, if I had an account at BitStamp and I wanted to send money to someone using Coinbase, then BitStamp and Coinbase would just make edits to their databases and settle up later. This is pretty similar to how the current banking system works, though Bitcoin could provide some additional transparency and security. This model is probably how microtransactions will work with Bitcoin someday, but it's desirable for larger transactions to be reasonably cheap on the real Bitcoin network.\n\nIf the average block size goes up too much, then only people with very high bandwidth will be able to run full nodes. This is extremely dangerous because if there is ever a hardfork, only full nodes are able to \"vote\". (This is a simplification. Bitcoin is not a democracy. The dynamics of how such a situation would play out are very complex.) It is absolutely essential for Bitcoin's survival that the majority of Bitcoin's *economic power* be held by people who are running full nodes. Otherwise, the few people who actually have influence over the network will be able to change the rules of Bitcoin, and no one will be able to stop them.\n\nThe average block size needs to be somewhere between those two extremes or else Bitcoin will become centralized. Thankfully, while the exact limits aren't known, the reasonable range of average block sizes is probably pretty large. Today, block sizes between 200 KB and 10 MB would probably be survivable. With all of the changes listed by Gavin in this article, 50-100 MB would be possible, and this could increase as worldwide bandwidth capacities increase. In my opinion it's always better to err on the side of smaller sizes, though, since too-large blocks are more dangerous than too-small blocks.\n\nBy the way: When people first hear about this, their first instinct is often to propose that Bitcoin should automatically adjust the max block size in the same way that it adjusts difficulty. Unfortunately, this is probably not possible. The appropriate max block size has to do with how much data the network *can safely support*. Determining this requires outside knowledge like worldwide bandwidth costs and the relative costliness of current Bitcoin fees. An algorithm can't figure this out.

It requires that maintainers have a dialogue with contributors if they feel that they're gaming their commits to try and gather the highest tips. This in my opinion is the best way to reward new or sporadic contributors since the maintainer does not have to keep track of who all is contributing what, and there is an immediate payout in response to the contribution.

A 3rd party couldnt set up and start issuing bitcoin or any other coin. First of all, there is a legal issue, second of all, who is going to trust them? When you have the blockchain, off-chain transactions become possible, because the blockchain can be used to verify the &amp;quot;integrity&amp;quot; of said institutions. Naturally there is going to be competition among the various payment processors, also called online wallets, in being the most transparant because thats what end users will want, presuambly. In fact, off-chain transactions is unavoidable, for example when it comes to micro tx. Also when/if miner fees begin to rise, there is going to be naturl pooling of transactions. Call it what you want. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That's who most people older than 35-40 in the US will think of when they hear that word. I'm sorry to say that Strom Thurmond was not a particularly admirable politician (big surprise, I know) [1].\n\nI know that Strom simply means \"stream\" in Swedish, but it's worth considering the different emotional impact different words have on people of different cultures when creating branding.  See the outcome of GM branding a car \"Nova\" (pronounced \"no va\") in South America.  I only mention it so you won't be surprised when people bring it up (and they will).\n\nIn any case, best of luck with your project.  It sounds exciting!
