            "body": "Because the primary reason Bitcoin grew so fast was due to a massive introduction of \"investor\"-type people when the hype train was rolling at full force last year in the run up to $1000. Every news agency was covering it and had a story, which perpetuated the run up in price itself. This was (and is) unsustainable.\n\nEventually, when the growth stopped, the same \"investor\"-types all started to leave. Some have held on, but ultimately, if they don't see a future higher price, they will leave at a different rate. It all depends on how stubborn they are as an investor. But eventually, if they don't see the price going up, they will all leave.\n\nWhat the \"investor\"-types don't understand is that Bitcoin, although designed to combat losses through government inflation and counterfeiting, is that it is meant to be a stable currency. This is stabilized by the demand for coins with demand for mining. Investors HATE stable. They don't make money buying a $600 Bitcoin and selling it 2 years later at $600.\n\nAnd so, the \"investor\"-type begins to cause ripples - panic, highs, and lows, mostly unintentionally, by their fear and greed. Volatility comes from them. And they all watch the prices fall, fear further fall, and cause other investors to make the price fall, and so on. Cascading rollercoaster ride.\n\nEventually, though, many of these \"investors\" give up. They leave the market place. The market stabilizes again. And normal growth continues at a normal pace again (based on higher adoption, and more people using it for long-term storage rather than investment). But these long-term holders won't jump in until they see a \"stable\" price.\n\nWhich brings me to the 2nd group of people, the mirror image of the \"investor\". There are \"fundamentalists\" who actually believe in Bitcoin's technology and usability. These people love what Bitcoin is, regardless of price. Some people think they are idiots, but they are foward-thinkers. They see the future and the benefit to Bitcoin. It's undeniable to them. They are not rocked by the heavy ocean tides. They are almost bulletproof to the degree that they are dissatisfied with the current financial system and world problems.\n\nUltimately the price will stabilize when the investors all leave and what remains are fundamentalists. And then, we can again begin the slope of steady growth.\n\nNot all the investors have left, so expect more bloodshed here on the price. The only way to prevent it at this point would be an artificial hype bubble perpetuated by the news outlets. But, given the recent memory of the $1000-crash it is unlikely that the hype news would be good anyways. It's much more likely that the hype would only crash it faster if they report on the crash.\n\nPersonally, I am OK with \"investors\" leaving. They don't contribute to Bitcoin as much. They waste everyone's time on the price and this is a time when we still need more focus on the technology rather than the price.\n\nBut there will always be investors, the greedy ones. And expect them to cause ripples (or tsunamis) and I simply steer clear of them. I don't jump in when I see a wave coming. Every time I bought into Bitcoin it was when I was sure that a majority of crazy investors have left, and Bitcoin seemed stable again (for several months in a row).",

This is stabilized by the demand for coins with demand for mining. Investors HATE stable. They don&amp;#39;t make money buying a $600 Bitcoin and selling it 2 years later at $600.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, the &amp;quot;investor&amp;quot;-type begins to cause ripples - panic, highs, and lows, mostly unintentionally, by their fear and greed. Volatility comes from them. And they all watch the prices fall, fear further fall, and cause other investors to make the price fall, and so on. Cascading rollercoaster ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, though, many of these &amp;quot;investors&amp;quot; give up. They leave the market place. The market stabilizes again. And normal growth continues at a normal pace again (based on higher adoption, and more people using it for long-term storage rather than investment). But these long-term holders won&amp;#39;t jump in until they see a &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the 2nd group of people, the mirror image of the &amp;quot;investor&amp;quot;. There are &amp;quot;fundamentalists&amp;quot; who actually believe in Bitcoin&amp;#39;s technology and usability. These people love what Bitcoin is, regardless of price. Some people think they are idiots, but they are foward-thinkers. They see the future and the benefit to Bitcoin. It&amp;#39;s undeniable to them. They are not rocked by the heavy ocean tides. They are almost bulletproof to the degree that they are dissatisfied with the current financial system and world problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the price will stabilize when the investors all leave and what remains are fundamentalists. And then, we can again begin the slope of steady growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all the investors have left, so expect more bloodshed here on the price. The only way to prevent it at this point would be an artificial hype bubble perpetuated by the news outlets. But, given the recent memory of the $1000-crash it is unlikely that the hype news would be good anyways. It&amp;#39;s much more likely that the hype would only crash it faster if they report on the crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am OK with &amp;quot;investors&amp;quot; leaving. They don&amp;#39;t contribute to Bitcoin as much. They waste everyone&amp;#39;s time on the price and this is a time when we still need more focus on the technology rather than the price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there will always be investors, the greedy ones. And expect them to cause ripples (or tsunamis) and I simply steer clear of them. I don&amp;#39;t jump in when I see a wave coming. Every time I bought into Bitcoin it was when I was sure that a majority of crazy investors have left, and Bitcoin seemed stable again (for several months in a row).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
