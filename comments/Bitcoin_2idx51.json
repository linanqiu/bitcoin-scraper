Then I buy back the previous fake coins at a much lower price without affecting the correctness of my balances, but I have more fiat now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To attract more users to my exchange, I can set transaction fee to 0% and have very low deposit/withdrawl fees. I can even pay interests if an user is willing to left his/her coins on my exchange, or launch an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; program (like BitVC from huobi.com) to collect more coins from big holders. In this way I have both huge amounts of BTC and fiat. They are owned by my customers but why not use them to make profit as long as they can never know what I am doing? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two options above involve creating FAKE buy/sell orders, but after a cycle of manipulation my balances still look good, i.e., no fake money, so hiding my actions to users is not hard. Actually creating fake orders is not necessary for the manipulation, as long as my exchange have enough coins/fiat; but it does reduces the cost of manipulation. To me, the entire manipulation process has a very low cost, because I can create fake orders and I don&amp;#39;t need to own huge amount of money myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I can drive price up or down, &lt;strong&gt;It seems to me that option (2) (driving price down) is more attractive to an exchange&lt;/strong&gt;, since transferring BTC from my exchange to others is fast and easy; I only need to move these BTC for a while to create a sell pressure, and users can&amp;#39;t observe this temporarily reduction in reserve. Option (1) involves transferring REAL money to other exchanges, perhaps in another country. Obviously, it is much easier to move coins from my wallets than transfer money from my company bank account to other exchanges (which needs to bypass accounting audits, requires currency conversion, and imposes huge transaction fees and delay). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Audit and proof of solvency does not solve this problem, because an audit only proves that an exchange has enough coins at that time. Interestingly, OKCoin did an audit on August 24, but at that time BTC price is pretty stable and shortly after that audit, Bitcoin started to crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the reasons above, exchange whales are bear whales and have more incentive to crash Bitcoin, until the point that they think they have earned enough from it, maybe when the price is zero; one possibility is that, after destroying Bitcoin and earning enough fiat they could simply shut down their exchanges and invest something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the time being, please withdraw your coins from exchanges if you are a long-term holder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
