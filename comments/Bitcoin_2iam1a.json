The same power is of grave concern when it comes to cryptocurrencies. People are thinking short term when they pump PoS, they aren't thinking bigger picture. The bigger picture is that once someone achieves majority control over the units of currency in a PoS, they forever control the system itself, they become the Central Bank of the system.

It introduces it's own interesting problems especially visible in times like this. As the process of securing the network becomes more reliant on farming it requires those farms to benefit from the process. They have no affinity to the network other than meeting their costs, and profiting (otherwise why go through the trouble, right?). Bitcoin has some juice to squeeze out of it left but it will get to a point where there wont be as much juice to squeeze. These price fluctuations can render operations unprofitable and with no affinity to the network other than profit there's no need to continue operation.

You don't see fancy logos or marketing when you look at pictures of these places. They don't love the coin, they love the money.

It does have it's own concerns, but I think the outlook is far more favorable. As someone who hodls Bitcoins I'm not interested in seeing days like today, but ignoring the realities of the system is a dangerous game. It requires an ever increasing appreciation in value for the passive interest (profiteering) of securing the network. We have not seen anywhere near the same value appreciation since gox was fudging numbers.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the project i'm working on obviously. We've abstracted the volatility and ownership of the network (through NuShares) with the stability and utility of a currency (with NuBits). To believe that people would rather use a currency that can drop $150 per unit in one day as their day to day store of value, to me, is fallacious. Everything is capable of being replaced. Bitcoin is trying to advertise itself as a kitchen knife with a kitchen sink attached to it. It's impractical for the average consumer the way it's designed, but separating the components can produce some great utility.\n\nI'm still not sure how they're going to abstract the different utilities in a way that won't kill the network yet appeals to an average consumer.",

There&amp;#39;s a dangerous uncertainty regarding the capability of the networks future. Freedom is a double edge sword and the blade you use to cut others can cut you as well. Or at least in the case of Bitcoin just cash and and hit the power switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PoS coins don&amp;#39;t have that same unfavorable endgame scenario to worry about. It does have it&amp;#39;s own concerns, but I think the outlook is far more favorable. As someone who hodls Bitcoins I&amp;#39;m not interested in seeing days like today, but ignoring the realities of the system is a dangerous game. It requires an ever increasing appreciation in value for the passive interest (profiteering) of securing the network. We have not seen anywhere near the same value appreciation since gox was fudging numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of the project i&amp;#39;m working on obviously. We&amp;#39;ve abstracted the volatility and ownership of the network (through NuShares) with the stability and utility of a currency (with NuBits). To believe that people would rather use a currency that can drop $150 per unit in one day as their day to day store of value, to me, is fallacious. Everything is capable of being replaced. Bitcoin is trying to advertise itself as a kitchen knife with a kitchen sink attached to it. It&amp;#39;s impractical for the average consumer the way it&amp;#39;s designed, but separating the components can produce some great utility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still not sure how they&amp;#39;re going to abstract the different utilities in a way that won&amp;#39;t kill the network yet appeals to an average consumer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
