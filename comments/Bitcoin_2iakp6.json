When it comes to matters of what other people are thinking, none are qualified to speak for anyone else but themselves. Feel free to *speculate* what people are thinking, but identify your statements as mere speculation. When citing facts, try to be explicit as to what those facts mean to you; don't just mention a statistic and leave it for everyone else to infer what point you are trying to get across. Ask questions of which the answers might prove the point of either side of the discussion.\n\n&gt;I would like to see more people ... be more critical of things that are said on here. \n\nI, too, would like this. I would also like to see more people admit that they might be wrong and that others' criticisms are valid. I might very well have been wrong when I said *your* post was meant to antagonize, so I'm going to go strike that from my original post. But you are right that a lot of things are said here that are wholly unsupported by any facts, and I would love to see us act individually and collectively to point out when this happens. Make those who would make unsubstantiated claims of collective opinion support their claims; when they can't, you'll know to ignore anything else they say.",

Please don&amp;#39;t do that, you or anyone else reading this. Speak for yourself, speak your own opinions and identify them as solely your own. When it comes to matters of what other people are thinking, none are qualified to speak for anyone else but themselves. Feel free to &lt;em&gt;speculate&lt;/em&gt; what people are thinking, but identify your statements as mere speculation. When citing facts, try to be explicit as to what those facts mean to you; don&amp;#39;t just mention a statistic and leave it for everyone else to infer what point you are trying to get across. Ask questions of which the answers might prove the point of either side of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to see more people ... be more critical of things that are said on here. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, too, would like this.
