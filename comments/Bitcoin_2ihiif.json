This is the real reason for the downtrend, I am convinced of it. \n\nI don't know much about markets, but I know that confidence in Bitcoin was profoundly hurt by the ghash.io crisis. This erosion of confidence was deep and profound. It tore at the very fabric of one of the basic things people had come to believe made Bitcoin special, namely, decentralization. \n\nThe fact that Peter Todd just threw up his hands in despair, and it seemed that Bitcoin was completely incapable of evolving past the problem, just broke something for people. No voice really stepped forward proposing a real solution, there was just silence. \n\nAnd what happened was this kind of loss of faith in Proof-of-Work, and a growing belief that centralization is inevitable, and since it is inevitable, we might as well go to the dark side and embrace proof-of-stake, since it offers many advantages once decentralization is off the table. And with that, slowly you had this growing movement of belief that Bitcoin has served its purpose, but it is time for us to move onto more advanced, 2nd generation, proof-of-stake (or its variants) coins. \n\nBut fundamentally, the embrace of these proof-of-stake oriented consensus algorithms really comes down to one thing, a deep feeling that Proof-of-work fails to maintain decentralization, and therefore all the wasted electricity is just that . . . wasted electricity. \n\nMany people at the time were convinced that ghash.io was going to really hurt the price in the long run. I think those people have been proven correct. Of course, there is no way to prove that they were correct, but the price did go down, and consistently, just as predicted. \n\nI believe proof-of-work is inherently superior to the proof-of-stake oriented algorithms for the simple reason that it separates power over the monetary system from possession of the majority of coins. Of course, someone with a lot of coins can pull market manipulation and what not, as Barewhale demonstrates, but they cannot change the code, they cannot double spend, they do not control the network just by virtue of having the most Bitcoins. With Proof-of-stake, they do. And in my opinion that is basically dangerous. \n\nI feel that if increased decentralization could be restored, through eliminating the incentive for mining pools or some other method, confidence in Bitcoin would be restored at this fundamental level and the price would follow.
