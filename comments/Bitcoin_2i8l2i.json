We have to agree, Its all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about instead of shunning and running from the volatility of Bitcoin, we embrace it. For example,  we use a +(plus) -(negative) mind set to approaching how to use it even if it&amp;#39;s volitale and if markets are scared of  bitcoin&amp;#39;s volatility then they only open market for its use when its trading at a safe volatility. Say like maximum +20 or -20 $ volatility or some other safe volatility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even further Businesss might say they will only accept bit coin when Volatility is  + 5 or - 5 $  or 10$ or 2$ or 1 etc etc where they feel safe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RIght now Bitcoin;s Volatility is all over the place but In the future when the value of bitcoin stabilizes, with slight jumps either way,  then people if made aware by some monthly vitality condition report can trade at safe volatility conditions. These conditions  will help USERS be aware of any loss or gain they might be exposed to by the transaction of bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My idea goes as far as this. My other thoughts for how to come to these Votality Condtions is that the main representative for Bitcoin takes it upon themselves to keep up with the Votality conditions for each month and some how report the conditions for the people. Which will help decide if markets want to open their arms to bitcoin for the month. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this is future thinking when Bitcoin Volatility is slowed down but still can&amp;#39;t stabilize. Last thoughts, I feel that if someone was trading me something and told me the value could go either way but not to some crazy point as long as I understand I would probably continue on with the trade. I also understand people need exacts but hopefully we can find a way that helps both sides. \n(The people okay with a +- value and people who need exacts)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for any mistakes on grammar.
