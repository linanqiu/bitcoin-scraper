No.\n\nA private/publickey is any 256 digit number. An address is only 160 digits. You are squashing large numbers in to smaller numbers. The large numbers can be different but end up with the same, smaller, hash. It's very rare and unlikely to occur.\n\nThat's a collision. It doesn't have to be big to small, but that murkies the water. In your question it looks like you say \"The same private key hashes to the same address twice\" and that's true. Hashes are one way and the same input always gets the same output. But when the input is larger than the output there is a chance collisions occur.\n\nEssentially you have 160 digits worth of \"symbol\" combinations to represent 256 digits worth of \"data.\" It's just not possible. Think about pouring shots from a bottle of booze. You'll never fit the entire bottle in a single shot glass but on very very rare occasions you or someone else will pour a shot with the exact amount of booze in it as you or someone else has at some time in the past. Bad analogy but kind of the same idea.\n\n\nFor your last question. Yeah but no.\n\nSee above about how many numbers there are. It's basically the same thing as saying \"I start my wallet and it generates a key someone else is using or have used before.\" It's extremely unlikely.\n\nFurthermore, there is something called a birthday attack.

Wouldn&amp;#39;t these keys be the same for all intents and purposes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I just had an interesting but slightly unrelated thought. The total money supply will slowly diffuse into more and more addresses as time goes by. Because of the transaction fee, many people will lose a few satoshis here and there because messing up change addresses thus getting balances too low to extract without losing money. If a large fraction of all addresses contain minuscule amounts of dust it may become relatively probable to draw an address at random containing a non-zero balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
