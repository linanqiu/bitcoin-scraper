Plus if you're going to quote in its entirety:\n\n“Bitcoin is a technological tour de force. **640K should be enough for anybody**. Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers we’re talking about aren’t trying to be anonymous. You know they’re willing to be known so the Bitcoin technology is key and you could add to it or you could build a similar technology where there’s enough attribution that people feel comfortable this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering.“\n\n\n\n\n\nʲᵘˢᵗ ᵏᶦᵈᵈᶦᶰᵍ ᴳᵃᵗᵉˢ ᶰᵉᵛᵉʳ ˢᵃᶦᵈ ᵗʰᵃᵗ\n\n\n",
