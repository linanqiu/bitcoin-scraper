Make it so that a completely voluntary and very small fee can be added to each time a purchase is made on Open Bazaar.  It can easily be unchecked, but when you list fees at checkout that end up being $0, I imagine a lot of people will leave that tiny amount on there, knowing that it goes to a bitcoin wallet agreed upon by the developers.
