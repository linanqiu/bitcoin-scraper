So, one of the reddit post in question is here:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1dmznd/should_we_be_worried_showing_on_login_page/\nIs that post an example of what the FBI is claiming? Or is it different?\n\nWow, it looks like the Feds are telling the truth and SilkRoad screwed up.\n\nI'll try breaking it down in plain speak, starting with the post you reference here:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1dmznd/should_we_be_worried_showing_on_login_page/\n\nThis appears to be a reddit post, put up on May 3, 2013, in a [SR subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/) from a user explaining that on SilkRoad's login page a bunch of data is showing. As anekdotos correctly notes it appears the command \"print_r($_SERVER);\" is in SilkRoad's login page script, which outputs data, which includes a lot of information - of greatest significance, the server's IP address.\n\nApparently other users saw it too, so the reddit post doesn't appear to be fake. That data probably *was* showing on SilkRoad's login page. Obviously the feds were monitoring SilkRoad, meaning they too probably saw that data, again, containing the server's IP address. AFAIK SilkRoad always used a CAPTCHA on their login page. I'm guessing the feds thought their CAPTCHA was \"leaking\" as I'm guessing they don't have a bunch of web developers sitting around which they can consult. So that's probably why they refer to the CAPTCHA, but that hasn't anything to do with it. My guess is the command was put in for debugging, but wasn't removed - either that, or SR's login page was hacked and somebody put it there (which seems to me more fitting for that type of command).",

With bullets designed for full house 10mm auto loads (165gr Gold Dot or barnes bullets), 10mm auto hits are devastating to targets and have enough energy to cause tissue damage with their energy dump, not just the permanent wound channel of the bullet.\n\nAlso, statistically if you don't hit an intruder with the first 2-3 rounds, you typically don't hit them at all because the intruder gets behind cover.  Cover, you know the thing that the 10mm auto will blast right through vs. the 9mm...  Read up on real-life shooting incidents, not mall ninja zombie fantasies.   \n\nSo yeah, go buy a real handgun caliber and stop repeating the same BS about glocks and 9mm.",

The 10mm auto is a superior handgun round overall.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9mm has &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; causes much less tissue damage and has less penetration than the 10mm.  With bullets designed for full house 10mm auto loads (165gr Gold Dot or barnes bullets), 10mm auto hits are devastating to targets and have enough energy to cause tissue damage with their energy dump, not just the permanent wound channel of the bullet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, statistically if you don&amp;#39;t hit an intruder with the first 2-3 rounds, you typically don&amp;#39;t hit them at all because the intruder gets behind cover.  Cover, you know the thing that the 10mm auto will blast right through vs. the 9mm...  Read up on real-life shooting incidents, not mall ninja zombie fantasies.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, go buy a real handgun caliber and stop repeating the same BS about glocks and 9mm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

As anekdotos correctly notes it appears the command \"print_r($_SERVER);\" is in SilkRoad's login page script, which outputs data, which includes a lot of information - of greatest significance, the server's IP address.\n\n&gt;Apparently other users saw it too, so the reddit post doesn't appear to be fake. That data probably was showing on SilkRoad's login page. Obviously the feds were monitoring SilkRoad, meaning they too probably saw that data, again, containing the server's IP address. AFAIK SilkRoad always used a CAPTCHA on their login page. \n\n&gt;I'm guessing the feds thought their CAPTCHA was \"leaking\" as I'm guessing they don't have a bunch of web developers sitting around which they can consult. So that's probably why they refer to the CAPTCHA, but that hasn't anything to do with it. My guess is the command was put in for debugging, but wasn't removed - either that, or SR's login page was hacked and somebody put it there (which seems to me more fitting for that type of command).",
